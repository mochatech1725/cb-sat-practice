      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. When a data set has an odd number of elements, the median can be found by ordering the values from least to greatest and determining the middle value. Out of the 27 different numbers in this data set, 13 numbers are below the median, one number is exactly 33, and 13 numbers are above the median. When 7 is subtracted from each number below the median and added to each number above the median, the data spread out from the median. Since the median of this data set, 33, is equivalent to the mean of the data set, the data also spread out from the mean. Since standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data are from the mean, a greater spread from the mean indicates an increased standard deviation. Choice A is incorrect. All the numbers less than the median decrease and all the numbers greater than the median increase, but the median itself doesn’t change. Choices B and C are incorrect. The mean of a data set is found by dividing the sum of the values by the number of values. The net change from subtracting 7 from 13 numbers and adding 7 to 13 numbers is zero.

The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is  cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is 5% of the daily allowance for adults. If p percent of an adult’s daily allowance of potassium is provided by x servings of Crunchy Grain cereal per day, which of the following expresses p in terms of x ? A. B. C. D.",

      "answer_choices": {},
      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. It’s given that each serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 5% of an adult’s daily allowance of potassium, so x servings would provide x times 5%. The percentage of an adult’s daily allowance of potassium, p, is 5 times the number of servings, x. Therefore, the percentage of an adult’s daily allowance of potassium can be expressed as . Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may result from incorrectly converting 5% to its decimal equivalent, which isn’t necessary since p is expressed as a percentage. Additionally, choices C and D are incorrect because the context should be represented by a linear relationship, not by an exponential relationship.",

Since 1 pound = 16 ounces, the number of pounds that is equivalent to 120 ounces is pounds. Therefore, 7.5 pounds of chocolate are needed to make the 48 muffins. Choice B is incorrect. If 10 pounds of chocolate were needed to make 48 muffins, then the total number of ounces of chocolate needed would be  ounces. The number of ounces of chocolate per muffin would then be ounces per muffin, not 2.5 ounces per muffin. Choices C and D are also incorrect. Following the same procedures as used to test choice B gives 16.8 ounces per muffin for choice C and 40 ounces per muffin for choice D, not 2.5 ounces per muffin.

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Sample size is an appropriate reason for the margin of error to change. In general, a smaller sample size increases the margin of error because the sample may be less representative of the whole population. Choice A is incorrect. The margin of error will depend on the size of the sample of recorded votes, not the number of votes that could not be recorded. In any case, the smaller number of votes that could not be recorded for sample A would tend to decrease, not increase, the comparative size of the margin of error. Choice B is incorrect. Since the percent in favor for sample A is the same distance from 50% as the percent in favor for sample B, the percent of favorable responses doesn’t affect the comparative size of the margin of error for the two samples. Choice C is incorrect. If sample A had a larger margin of error than sample B, then sample A would tend to be less representative of the population.

Since each data set in the choices is ordered and contains exactly 9 data values, the 5th value in each is the median. It follows that the median of the data set in choice C is 32. The sum of the positive differences between 32 and each of the values that are less than 32 is significantly smaller than the sum of the positive differences between 32 and each of the values that are greater than 32. If 32 were the mean, these sums would have been equal to each other. Therefore, the mean of this data set must be greater than 32. This can also be confirmed by calculating the mean as the sum of the values divided by the number of values in the data set:  . Choices A and B are incorrect. Each of the data sets in these choices is symmetric with respect to its median, so the mean and the median for each of these choices are equivalent. Choice D is incorrect. The median of this data set is 207. Since the sum of the positive differences between 207 and each of the values less than 207 is greater than the sum of the positive differences between 207 and each value greater than 207 in this data set, the mean must be less than the median.

      "explanation": "Choice A is correct. The data show a strong linear relationship between x and y. The line of best fit for a set of data is a linear equation that minimizes the distances from the data points to the line. An equation for the line of best fit can be written in slope-intercept form, , where m is the slope of the graph of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph. Since, for the data shown, the y-values increase as the x-values increase, the slope of a line of best fit must be positive. The data shown lie almost in a line, so the slope can be roughly estimated using the formula for slope, . The leftmost and rightmost data points have coordinates of about  and , so the slope is approximately , which is a little greater than 3. Extension of the line to the left would intersect the y-axis at about . Only choice A represents a line with a slope close to 3 and a y-intercept close to . Choice B is incorrect and may result from switching the slope and y-intercept. The line with a y-intercept of  and a slope of 0.8 is farther from the data points than the line with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of . Choices C and D are incorrect.
