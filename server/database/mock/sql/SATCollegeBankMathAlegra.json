    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. After using the auger for 5 hours, Hector had removed 24,000 – 19,350 = 4,650 bushels of corn from the\nstorage bin. During the 5-hour period, the auger removed corn from the bin at a constant rate of  bushels per\nhour. Assuming the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, after x hours it will have removed 930x bushels of corn.\nBecause the bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector started using the auger, the equation 24,000 – 930x = 12,840\ncan be used to find the number of hours, x, Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the\nbin. Subtracting 12,840 from both sides of this equation and adding 930x to both sides of the equation yields 11,160 = 930x.\nDividing both sides of this equation by 930 yields x = 12. Therefore, Hector will have been using the auger for 12 hours when\n12,840 bushels of corn remain in the storage bin.\nChoice A is incorrect. Three hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 3(930) = 21,210 bushels of corn remained,\nnot 12,840. Choice B is incorrect. Seven hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 7(930) = 17,490 bushels of corn\nwill remain, not 12,840. Choice C is incorrect. Eight hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 8(930) = 16,560\nbushels of corn will remain, not 12,840.",

    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Since 2.74 is a constant term, it represents an actual price of gas rather than a measure of change in gas\nprice. To determine what gas price it represents, find x such that F(x) = 2.74, or 2.74 = 2.74 – 0.19(x – 3). Subtracting 2.74\nfrom both sides gives 0 = –0.19(x – 3).

Therefore, the average price\nof gas is $2.74 per gallon 3 months after September 1, 2014, which is December 1, 2014.\nChoice A is incorrect. Since 2.74 is a constant, not a multiple of x, it cannot represent a rate of change in price. Choice B is\nincorrect. The difference in the average price from September 1, 2014, to December 1, 2014, is F(3) – F(0) = 2.74 – 0.19(3 –\n3) – (2.74 – 0.19(0 – 3)) = 2.74 – (2.74 + 0.57) = –0.57, which is not 2.74. Choice C is incorrect. The average price per gallon\non September 1, 2014, is F(0) = 2.74 – 0.19(0 – 3) = 2.74 + 0.57 = 3.31, which is not 2.74.",

The price per adult ticket is $12, and the price per child ticket is $8. Since the\ntheater received a total of $300 for the 30 tickets sold, it follows that 12a + 8c = 300. To eliminate c, the first equation can be\nmultiplied by 8 and then subtracted from the second equation:\nBecause the question asks for the amount spent on adult tickets, which is 12a dollars, the resulting equation can be\nmultiplied by 3 to give 3(4a) = 3(60) = 180. Therefore, $180 was spent on adult tickets.\nAlternate approach: If all the 30 tickets sold were child tickets, their total price would be 30($8) = $240. Since the actual total\nprice of the 30 tickets was $300, the extra $60 indicates that a certain number of adult tickets, a, were sold. Since the price\nof each adult ticket is $4 more than each child ticket, 4a = 60, and it follows that 12a = 180.",

Because the airline sold a total of 120 tickets for this flight, it must be true that x + y = 120. The amount, in\ndollars, collected from the sale of x tickets at $90 each is represented by 90x. The amount, in dollars, collected from the sale\nof the remaining y tickets at $250 each is represented by 250y. It is given that a total of $27,600 was collected from the sale\nof all tickets. Therefore, it must also be true that 90x + 250y = 27,600.\nChoice B is incorrect. The total number of tickets sold is represented correctly as x + y = 120. The total amount, in dollars,\ncollected from the sale of the x tickets at $90 each and the remaining tickets, y, at $250 has been correctly represented as\n90x + 250y. However, according to the information given, this total should be equal to 27,600, not 120(27,600) dollars.\nChoice C is incorrect. The total number of tickets sold has been correctly represented as x + y. However, according to the\ninformation given, this total should be equal to 120, not 27,600, as shown in choice C. The total amount, in dollars, collected\nfrom the sale of the x tickets at $90 each and the remaining tickets, y, at $250 has been correctly represented as 90x + 250y.\nHowever, according to the information given, this total should be equal to 27,600, not 120(27,600) dollars. Choice D is\nincorrect. The two equations given in choice D have no meaning in this context.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that a neighborhood consists of a -hectare park and a -hectare residential area and that the\ntotal number of trees in the neighborhood is . It's also given that the equation  represents this\nsituation. Since the total number of trees for a given area can be determined by taking the number of hectares times the\naverage number of trees per hectare, this must mean that the terms  and  correspond to the number of trees in the\npark and in the residential area, respectively. Since  corresponds to the number of trees in the park, and  is the size of the\npark, in hectares,  must represent the average number of trees per hectare in the park.\nChoice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.\nChoice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.\nChoice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.",

    "question_text": "The average annual energy cost for a certain home is $4,334. The homeowner\nplans to spend $25,000 to install a geothermal heating system. The homeowner\nestimates that the average annual energy cost will then be $2,712.

    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The savings each year from installing the geothermal heating system will be the average annual energy\ncost for the home before the geothermal heating system installation minus the average annual energy cost after the\ngeothermal heating system installation, which is  dollars. In t years, the savings will be\ndollars. Therefore, the inequality that can be solved to find the number of years after installation at which the total amount of\nenergy cost savings will exceed (be greater than) the installation cost, $25,000, is .\nChoice A is incorrect. It gives the number of years after installation at which the total amount of energy cost savings will be\nless than the installation cost. Choice C is incorrect and may result from subtracting the average annual energy cost for the\nhome from the onetime cost\nof the geothermal heating system installation. To find the predicted total savings, the predicted average cost should be\nsubtracted from the average annual energy cost before the installation, and the result should be multiplied by the number of\nyears, t. Choice D is incorrect and may result from misunderstanding the context. The ratio  compares the average\nenergy cost before installation and the average energy cost after installation; it does not represent the savings.",

So the perimeter is .\nChoice A is incorrect because it is the sum of one length and one width, which is only half the perimeter. Choice C is\nincorrect and may result from using the formula for the area instead of the formula for the perimeter and making a\ncalculation error.
