    'Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly
double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the
description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms
is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to
evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed,
the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of
invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.
B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri
but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.
C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical
species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.
D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and
colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.',

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the
different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the
number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can
only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means
there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The
text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological
variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify
microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect
on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar
numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from
differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated
some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas
Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many
more species than Bianchi and Morri did.
Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate
species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the
studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s
count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of
Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been
less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues
were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and
Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation
would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as
variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll
and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and
Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report
fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported
many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and
colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should
have been even larger.',

    'The ancient Greek concept of “mimesis,” a term used in the works of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers in
discussions of representational art—visual, performance, or literary art that aims to depict the real world—is a foundational
concept of the Western philosophy of aesthetics. Mimesis is typically translated as “imitation” in modern editions of ancient
Greek texts, but scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: “imitation” implies that art merely copies—and
is thus by definition entirely derivative of—a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating “mimesis”
thusly obscures the multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality.
Which statement, if true, would most directly support the claim by Halliwell presented in the text?
A. One of the earliest appearances of mimesis’s root word, mimos, can be found in an ancient Greek tragedy in reference to
dramatic impersonation, and the mim- root came to be generally associated with the musical and poetic arts by the fifth
century BCE.
B. Both Plato’s and Aristotle’s theorizations of mimesis examine the psychological effects that works of art induce in the
viewer or listener.
C. Although several of Plato’s earliest philosophical works discuss aesthetic ideas, the term “mimesis” doesn’t appear in
Plato’s discussions of art until Cratylus, a relatively late work.
D. Although Plato’s writings typically characterize representational art as an inferior reflection of the physical world,
Aristotle suggests that mimesis can refer to art’s capacity to envision hypothetical conditions that could, but don’t yet,
exist.',

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement that would support Halliwell’s claim that "imitation" is an overly
simplified translation of the word "mimesis" in the context of ancient Greek philosophical discussions of representational art
and that, because it suggests a view of art as merely copying things that exist in reality, the translation obscures the fact that
Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality in varied ways. If Plato’s works
tend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of
mere imitation), while Aristotle’s works suggest that the term "mimesis" can refer to art’s ability to show conditions that don’t
currently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the
term "mimesis" means more than just "imitation" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship
between art and reality.
Choice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos first being used in drama and the root mim- coming to
be associated with music and poetry wouldn’t indicate anything about the meaning of the specific term "mimesis" as it was
used by ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on
Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the specific term is an oversimplification. Choice B is incorrect because the
issue of art’s psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is
related to reality, so the idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn’t
have any bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of that term oversimplifies the relationship between art and
reality. Further, this idea would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the
multifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art’s relation to reality. Choice C is
incorrect because the idea that Plato discussed aesthetics in his early works but didn’t use the term "mimesis" until later
doesn’t give any indication of how Plato or any other ancient Greek philosophers understood the relation between art and
reality, so it would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the term "mimesis" is oversimplified and
fails to reflect the varied ways the philosophers understood that relationship.',

    'Biologists have predicted that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature, but this hadn’t been tested in mountain
environments. Ornithologist Sahas Barve studied feathers from 249 songbird species inhabiting different elevations—and
thus experiencing different temperatures—in the Himalaya Mountains. He found that feathers of high-elevation species not
only have a greater proportion of warming downy sections to flat and smooth sections than do feathers of low-elevation
species, but high-elevation species’ feathers also tend to be longer, providing a thicker layer of insulation.

A. Barve’s investigation shows that some species of Himalayan songbirds have evolved feathers that better regulate body
temperature than do the feathers of other species, contradicting previous predictions.
B. Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, lending new
support to a general prediction.
C. Barve discovered that songbirds have adapted to their environment by growing feathers without flat and smooth
sections, complicating an earlier hypothesis.

by feather length than feather structure, challenging an established belief.',

    'Jean-Bernard Caron and colleagues recently discovered a cache of jellyfish fossils in the Burgess Shale, a site in the
Canadian Rockies that is rich in fossils from the Cambrian period (over 500 million years ago). Caron and colleagues claim
that these are the oldest jellyfish fossils ever discovered. In the past twenty years, two sites in China and the United States
have yielded fossils of a similar age that some experts believe are most likely jellyfish due to their shapes and the
appearance of projecting tentacles. But Caron and colleagues argue that the apparent tentacles are in fact the comb rows of
ctenophores, gelatinous animals that are only distantly related to jellyfish.
Which statement, if true, would most directly weaken the claim by Caron and colleagues about the fossils found in China and
the United States?
A. Sites in the Canadian Rockies from later periods than the Cambrian period have yielded fossils that have been
conclusively identified as ctenophore fossils.
B. The fossils found in China and the United States are so poorly preserved that though they cannot be conclusively
identified as jellyfish, they cannot be conclusively identified as ctenophores either.
C. While ctenophore fossils have been discovered in China and the United States, they have never been discovered in the
Burgess Shale.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement that, if true, would most directly weaken Caron and colleagues’
claim that the apparent tentacles in the Chinese and American fossils are actually ctenophore comb rows. If the fossils are
so poorly preserved that they cannot be conclusively identified as either organism, neither the claim that they are jellyfish nor,

Choice A is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. These fossils are said
to be "of a similar age" to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice
suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores after the Cambrian would have any bearing on whether the Cambrian
fossils from the US and China are ctenophores. Choice C is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are
ctenophores, not jellyfish. Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in
Canada) would affect whether the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron’s claim is

    'The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which premiered in New York City in 2011,
transforms its performance space—a five-story warehouse—into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through
the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops,
confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play’s refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges
on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue’s immense and intricate layout generates.

A. The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play’s creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a
way that venues from earlier productions could not.
B. Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way

    'Although many transposons, DNA sequences that move within an organism’s genome through shuffling or duplication, have
become corrupted and inactive over time, those from the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) family appear to remain
active in the genomes of some species. In humans, they are functionally important within the hippocampus, a brain structure
that supports complex cognitive processes. When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus—an animal

In the United States, firms often seek incentives from municipal governments to expand to those municipalities. A team of
political scientists hypothesized that municipalities are much more likely to respond to firms and offer incentives if
expansions can be announced in time to benefit local elected officials than if they can’t. The team contacted officials in
thousands of municipalities, inquiring about incentives for a firm looking to expand and indicating that the firm would
announce its expansion on a date either just before or just after the next election.

    'One recognized social norm of gift giving is that the time spent obtaining a gift will be viewed as a reflection of the gift’s
thoughtfulness. Marketing experts Farnoush Reshadi, Julian Givi, and Gopal Das addressed this view in their studies of
norms specifically surrounding the giving of gift cards, noting that while recipients tend to view digital gift cards (which can
be purchased online from anywhere and often can be redeemed online as well) as superior to physical gift cards (which
sometimes must be purchased in person and may only be redeemable in person) in terms of usage, 94.8 percent of

Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. gift givers likely overestimate the amount of effort required to use digital gift cards and thus mistakenly assume gift

B. physical gift cards are likely preferred by gift recipients because the tangible nature of those cards offers a greater
psychological sense of ownership than digital gift cards do.
C. physical gift cards are likely less desirable to gift recipients than digital gift cards are because of the perception that

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of perceptions of digital versus
physical gift cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of "the time spent obtaining a gift...as a reflection of the
gift’s thoughtfulness" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards
view them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found
physical gift cards more "socially acceptable" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards
"can be purchased online from anywhere" with the fact that physical gift cards "sometimes must be purchased in person"—
suggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text’s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the
thoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift
cards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually
prefer gift cards in the more usable digital format.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients’ preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the
relative ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn’t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of
these factors. Moreover, the text establishes that recipients regard digital gift cards as easier to use and therefore preferable
to physical gift cards. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of
ownership toward them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the
text contrasts the two formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the difficulty involved in acquiring them
and discusses how those factors influence people’s perceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorrect because it
contradicts the text, which explains that recipients regard digital gift cards as superior to physical ones because they are
easier to use than physical cards, not because physical gift cards require greater effort to obtain than digital gift cards do.
Moreover, the text doesn’t characterize the effort required to obtain physical gift cards as "unnecessary."',

    'In her 2021 article “Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera,” scholar Anne Garner discusses John
Johnson (1882–1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign
pamphlets. Johnson recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless
—indeed, it wasn’t until 1968, after Johnson’s death, that Oxford University’s Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having
grasped the items’ potential value to historians and other researchers. Hence, the example of Johnson serves to ______

    'Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected “ephemera,” or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought
his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went
from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness.
Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson’s large
collection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have
access to that collection. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that “Oxford University’s
Bodleian Library acquired the collection,” but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so. Choice C is incorrect. This
inference isn’t supported. The text actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson’s collection lends support to
arguments that ephemera does hold value for scholars.',

    'A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the
painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the
rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be
overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of
both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.
Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth

Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques. According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in
the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts
might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the
Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn’t learn these
techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn’t invent the techniques independently, then the
most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion
about banana ripening time with and without ethylene at different temperatures. The graph shows that at 20°C, the gap
between the two bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2
gridlines (from about 4 days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph
shows that at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated
bananas to about 11 days for untreated bananas at 14°C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for
untreated bananas at 16°C; and from about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18°C).
Since the gap between the bars at each of these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps
is larger than the gap between the bars at 20°C, it can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute
change in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at 20°C.
Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than
ethylene-treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20°C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18°C,
16°C, and 14°C, respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at
the other temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20°C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively). The
information in the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20°C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas
at the other temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the
graph shows that as temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14°C
to about 5.5 days at 20°C, with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were
associated with absolute differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature
and differences in ripening time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated
bananas at 14°C and 16°C were about 8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of
ethylene-treated bananas at 18°C and 20°C, which were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated
with ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14°C and 16°C than at 18°C and 20°C.',

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about the difference between the proportions of Quito
residents and Lima residents using parks that is supported by the text. The text states that 82.9% of surveyed Quito
residents and 72.7% of surveyed Lima residents reported using their city’s parks. The text then notes that compared to Lima
respondents, a much smaller percentage of Quito respondents said they live within a 10-minute walk of a park. The text
concludes that because a greater proportion of Quito respondents used parks despite generally living farther from them than
Lima respondents did, "greater proximity"—being closer to a park—"can’t explain the difference in park use." That is, the text
makes the point that the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks is caused by
something other than the distance of the parks from city residents.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether the researchers had expected a particular result and doesn’t
indicate that they were surprised by the difference in park usage between the two cities’ residents. The text simply presents
the survey findings without stating the researchers’ expectations. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication
that there might be inaccuracies in the survey results; the text presents the findings as factual information and uses them as
the basis for a conclusion that a certain factor doesn’t explain differences in park usage between Quito and Lima residents.
Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any sources that predate the survey or suggest that the difference in
proportions was calculated using such sources. According to the text, the information about park usage came directly from
the survey of residents in Quito and Lima.',

    'The Mammillaria cactus M. boolii occurs naturally only in the state of Sonora in Mexico, and the smallness of its range
makes it especially vulnerable to extinction. The traditional single-species approach to conservation emphasizes the need to

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of conservation approaches for the
Mammillaria cactus M. boolii. The text establishes that M. boolii only grows naturally in the state of Sonora in Mexico, which
makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The text then contrasts two approaches to conservation: the traditional single-
species approach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based approach that considers the
interactions between climate, terrain, and various species in a geographical area. According to the text, conservationists
have recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this
ecosystem view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving M. boolii would likely fail to consider how the
cactus’s survival depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora’s ecosystem.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii throughout
Mexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses specifically on M. boolii in Sonora and different
approaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora
would reduce competition for M. boolii or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this specific dynamic. In
fact, the text implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn’t
specify how climatic changes might affect competition between species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t
suggest that the single-species approach would shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. boolii itself—rather, it

    'In 1534 CE, King Henry VIII of England split with the Catholic Church and declared himself head of the Church of England, in
part because Pope Clement VII refused to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Two years later, Henry VIII introduced a
policy titled the Dissolution of the Monasteries that by 1540 had resulted in the closure of all Catholic monasteries in
England and the confiscation of their estates. Some historians assert that the enactment of the policy was primarily
motivated by perceived financial opportunities.
Which quotation from a scholarly article best supports the assertion of the historians mentioned in the text?
A. “At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about 2 percent of the adult male population of England were monks;
by 1690, the proportion of the adult male population who were monks was less than 1 percent.”
B. “A contemporary description of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Michael Sherbrook’s Falle of the Religious Howses,
recounts witness testimony that monks were allowed to keep the contents of their cells and that the monastery timber
was purchased by local yeomen.”
C. “In 1535, the year before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry commissioned a survey of the value of
church holdings in England—the work, performed by sheriffs, bishops, and magistrates, began that January and was
swiftly completed by the summer.”
D. “The October 1536 revolt known as the Pilgrimage of Grace had several economic motives: high food prices due to a
poor harvest the prior year; the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which closed reliable sources of food and shelter for
many; and rents and taxes throughout Northern England that were not merely high but predatory.”',

    'Choice C is the best answer. The fact that Henry VIII commissioned a survey of church holdings just before enacting the
Dissolution of the Monasteries suggests that he was interested in the potential profits fr om claiming their assets. This
supports the historians’ assertion.
Choice A is incorrect. This choice describes a potential effect of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The decrease in the
proportion of monks in England isn’t relevant to the question of Henry VIII’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. Details about
how the monks were treated during the dissolution don’t address Henry VIII’s motivations for enacting the policy in the first
place. That the monks could keep the content of their cells (their rooms) and sell off the timber they’d harvested has no
impact on the value of the monasteries’ estates—their land holdings. Choice D is incorrect. This choice mentions one impact
that the Dissolution of the Monasteries contributed to, two years after it happened. But it doesn’t help explain why Henry VIII
might have wanted to enact the policy in the first place.',

Research suggests that REM sleep in animals is homeostatically regulated: animals compensate for periods of REM sleep
deprivation by increasing subsequent REM sleep. When on land, fur seals get enough REM sleep, but during the weeks
they’re in the water, they get almost none. In a study of fur seals’ sleep habits, researchers recorded the REM sleep (as a

    'Choice C is the best answer. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate
with REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We’d also expect the seals to maintain those
elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM
sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically.
Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t support the conclusion. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then
we’d suspect the seals to sustain REM levels well above baseline for a prolonged period in order to compensate for weeks of
REM deprivation while in the water. Whether or not there’s a reduction in REM sleep from day 1 to day 2 doesn’t tell us how
REM sleep on those days relates to baseline, which is where our focus should be. Choice B is incorrect. The y-axis of this

Urbanization, industrialization, and the warming climate create thermal pollution (excess heat) in the shallow subsurface
soil. Susanne A. Benz and colleagues analyzed thousands of sites on three continents under one scenario in which surface
temperature remains at the current level and under another in which the surface reaches the maximum plausible
temperature. They then categorized each site according to the percentage of local home heating needs that could be met
using this excess subsurface heat. The team concluded that if surface temperature approaches the maximum plausible
level, the percentage of sites where thermal pollution could feasibly contribute to meeting home heating needs will increase.
Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Benz and colleagues’ conclusion?
A. Under both temperature conditions, less than 10% of sites were in the up-to-25% group, but at the maximum plausible

subsurface thermal pollution, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, more than 80% of sites can meet
greater than 25% of local home heating needs.

    'Choice D is the best answer. The researchers concluded that as we approach maximum plausible surface temperatures,
there will be a larger percentage of sites where thermal pollution could contribute to meeting home heating needs. By
showing that only a small percentage of homes can currently use thermal pollution for home heating, and that this
percentage would grow much larger at maximum plausible surface temperatures, this choice supports the researchers’
conclusion.
Choice A is incorrect. We do not know how many sites could have all (i.e., 100%) of their local heating needs met by thermal
pollution, as the graph only classifies sites by whether "0%," "Up to 25%," and "More than 25%" of heating needs could be met.
Choice B is incorrect. The graph is not depicting need for supplemental heating from thermal pollution, but rather potential to
use thermal pollution for supplemental heating. Choice C is incorrect. The graph indicates that, at current surface

meet any local home heating needs.',

    'Roasted green chiles are a popular ingredient in Southwestern cuisine, but the traditional roasting method of burning
propane is not environmentally friendly. To see if solar power could provide a better alternative, engineer Kenneth Armijo and
his team roasted batches of green chiles using between 38 and 42 heliostats, which are devices that concentrate sunlight.
The team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found
that propane yielded faster results. While the fastest solar-roasted green chiles took six minutes, batches using propane
took only four. Armijo hypothesizes that they can reduce the roasting time for solar-roasted green chiles by using more
heliostats.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support Armijo’s hypothesis?
A. The temperature inside the roasting drum is distributed more evenly when roasting green chiles with solar power than
with propane.
B. Attempts to roast green chiles using 50 heliostats yields results in fewer than six minutes.
C. Green chile connoisseurs prefer the flavor of solar-roasted green chiles over the flavor of propane-roasted green chiles.

Choice A is incorrect. The evenness of temperature in the roasting drum doesn’t tell us about the speed of the roasting
process, which is what Armijo’s hypothesis is concerned with. Choice C is incorrect. Armijo’s hypothesis is focused on the
speed of the roasting process, not the flavor of the resulting roasted chiles. Choice D is incorrect. Though Armijo’s

    'Baltimore, Maryland, has installed engineered structures along 71% of its shoreline to protect infrastructure from wave
erosion and other hazards, a practice known as shoreline hardening. To evaluate the responses of waterbirds to two types of
hardening structures—riprap and bulkheads—Diann Prosser et al. surveyed waterbird communities consisting of the tundra
swan, the great blue heron, and 62 other species at different sites in the Chesapeake Bay on the US East Coast. Utilizing the
Index of Waterbird Community Integrity (IWCI), on which a high score corresponds to high community integrity, the
researchers found that bulkheads are more strongly negatively correlated with waterbird community integrity than is riprap.
Which finding, if true, would most directly illustrate the researchers’ finding?
A. The difference in average IWCI scores for waterbird communities at Stony and Old Road, two sites with a higher
percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads than of riprap, was statistically insignificant.
B. Waterbird communities at Old Road, a site with a relatively high percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads, had
lower average IWCI scores than did waterbird communities at Miles, a site with a relatively high percentage of shoreline
consisting of riprap.
C. Waterbird communities at Curtis, a site with a high percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap, had lower
average IWCI scores than did waterbird communities at Onancock, a site with a low percentage of shoreline consisting of
bulkheads and riprap.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly illustrate the researchers’ finding
about waterbird responses to shoreline hardening structures. The text explains that using the IWCI, an index on which higher
scores indicate higher community integrity, researchers found that bulkheads are more strongly negatively correlated with
waterbird community integrity than riprap is—that is, that bulkheads reduce the integrity of waterbird communities more than
riprap does. The finding that waterbird communities at a site with a relatively high percentage of bulkheads along the
shoreline (Old Road) had lower average IWCI scores than waterbird communities at a site with a relatively high percentage of
riprap along the shoreline (Miles) did would illustrate the researchers’ finding, since it would be an example of lower
waterbird community integrity in a location with substantial bulkhead presence than in a location with substantial riprap
presence.
Choice A is incorrect because a finding of similar waterbird community integrity in two sites predominated by bulkheads
wouldn’t reveal anything about waterbird community integrity at sites predominated by riprap or how waterbird community
integrity compares between the two types of sites. Thus, the finding wouldn’t illustrate the discovery of a difference in how
bulkheads and riprap correlate with waterbird community integrity. Choice C is incorrect because it presents a finding that
compares waterbird community integrity at sites with different overall amounts of shoreline hardening but without
distinguishing between bulkheads and riprap. Such a distinction would be necessary to illustrate the researchers’ finding of a
difference in how bulkheads and riprap each correlate with waterbird community integrity. Choice D is incorrect because it
presents a finding that addresses a difference in waterbird community integrity between one site with equal percentages of
bulkheads and riprap along its shoreline (Curtis) and one site with unequal percentages of bulkheads and riprap (Miles) but
without indicating whether bulkheads or riprap were more prevalent at Miles. This finding wouldn’t provide any clear
information about how bulkheads and riprap each correlate with waterbird community integrity, so it wouldn’t illustrate the
researchers’ finding of a difference between those correlations.',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the evolution of bipedalism in
humans. According to the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the behavior evolved
from an ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, as modern chimpanzees and gorillas do.
However, the finding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms
to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began
moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods.
Choice B is incorrect because the finding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in
trees doesn’t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors.
Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was
already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time. Choice C is
incorrect because the finding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any
insight into how difficult it would’ve been to move between the ground and the trees without bipedalism; there’s no
suggestion that climbing or moving in trees depends on the ability to walk on two legs rather than four, even if that ability
might be helpful in certain circumstances. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that orangutans (a relative of humans)
sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t suggest that a knuckle-walking human ancestor could’ve easily moved on two
legs in trees. Although the text indicates that bipedalism may have evolved from a human ancestor that mostly stayed on the

understand what effects low doses of H₂S might have on plant growth. They treated bean, corn, wheat, and pea seeds with
various concentrations (measured in micromoles per liter) of H₂S and tracked the germination of those seeds along with the
germination of untreated seeds. Treatment with particular concentrations of H₂S was associated with accelerated
germination: for example, ______

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view Siemomysł and Mieszko II Lambert
that is supported by the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of different members. The text refers to
two of the rulers in the Piast dynasty by name: Mieszko II Lambert, whose rule was known to have occurred from 1025 to
1031 CE, and Siemomysł ("whose historical actuality is disputed"), for whom less is known and who therefore is the subject
of debate among historians. The text further casts doubt about Siemomysł by stating that he is "said to have ruled" during
the 10th century, or the 900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn’t rule. The text also mentions that the chronicle’s
documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lambert. This
indicates that historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert was an actual historical figure, but they disagree about whether
Siemomysł existed.
Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the Gesta principum Polonorum’s documentation of Siemomysł comes
from oral tradition—spoken rather than written documentation—unlike its records of rulers who came after Siemomysł. This
suggests that the chronicle provides less reliable evidence rather than more evidence for Siemomysł’s existence in the 900s
(or the 10th century) than it does for later rulers like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. Choice C is
incorrect because the text indicates the opposite: Siemomysł supposedly ruled earlier in the 10th century, while Mieszko II
Lambert ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. The 10th century spans the years from 901 to 1000 CE, so Siemomysł is believed to
have ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lambert did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text
mentions that information in the written chronicle Gesta principum Polonorum draws its information about Siemomysł from
the oral tradition, it doesn’t mention orally transmitted stories about Mieszko II Lambert. Instead, it states that the chronicle’s
documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition unlike the records of later rulers do, which suggests that the
documentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lambert did not rely on oral tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made
about how convincing the orally transmitted stories of each ruler are to historians.',

    'Neural networks are computer models intended to reflect the organization of human brains and are often used in studies of
brain function. According to an analysis of 11,000 such networks, Rylan Schaeffer and colleagues advise caution when
drawing conclusions about brains from observations of neural networks. They found that when attempting to mimic grid
cells (brain cells used in navigation), while 90% of the networks could accomplish navigation-related tasks, only about 10%
of those exhibited any behaviors similar to those of grid cells. But even this approximation of grid-cell activity has less to do
with similarity between the neural networks and biological brains than it does with the rules programmed into the networks.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the claim in the underlined sentence?
A. The rules that allow for networks to exhibit behaviors like those of grid cells have no equivalent in the function of
biological brains.
B. The networks that do not exhibit behaviors like those of grid cells were nonetheless programmed with rules that had
proven useful in earlier neural-network studies.
C. Neural networks can often accomplish tasks that biological brains do, but they are typically programmed with rules to

WestMidwest
Electric companies that use wind turbines rely on weather forecasts to predict the maximum amount of power, in megawatt-
hours (MWh), they can generate using wind so that they can determine how much they’ll need to generate from other
sources. When winds are stronger than they were forecast to be, however, the predicted maximum amount of electricity wind
turbines could generate will be too low. For example, the graph shows that for the West region, the winds were ______

Flint artifacts dating to 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago have been recovered from the Evron Quarry in Israel. Likely created by
the hominin Homo erectus, the artifacts have no visual features suggesting that they were exposed to fir  e, leading some
scholars to conclude that these hominins had not acquired control of fir   e. But Zane Stepka and colleagues recently used a

    'Although it’s clear that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, astronomers have debated whether the evidence of ancient
water reflects a prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions—the so-called wet and warm scenario—or a brief period of melting

this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t provide support for the researchers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin
have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would
support the "wet and warm" theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to
the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not
provide support for the researchers’ conclusions, but rather the opposite. A "massive but short lived influx" of liquid water is
not the same as a "prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions." It more reflects the opposing theory, a "brief period of

Choice A is incorrect. We don’t have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there’s no basis for this
inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in response to various F.
hypoleuca dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food received based on dialect preference. Therefore, there’s no

    'In the 1980s, many musicians and journalists in the English-speaking world began to draw attention to music from around
the globe—such as mbaqanga from South Africa and quan họ from Vietnam—that can’t be easily categorized according to
British or North American popular music genres, typically referring to such music as “world music.” While some scholars
have welcomed this development for bringing diverse musical forms to prominence in countries where they’d previously
been overlooked, musicologist Su Zheng claims that the concept of world music homogenizes highly distinct traditions by
reducing them all to a single category.
Which finding about mbaqanga and quan họ, if true, would most directly support Zheng’s claim?
A. Mbaqanga and quan họ developed independently of each other and have little in common musically.
B. Mbaqanga is significantly more popular in the English-speaking world than quan họ is.
C. Mbaqanga and quan họ are now performed by a diverse array of musicians with no direct connections to South Africa or

    'Choice A is the best answer. Zheng’s claim is that the idea of world music “homogenizes” (meaning makes similar) distinct
kinds of music by reducing them to one category. In other words, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful
oversimplification of diverse musical forms. To support this claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so
different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. If it’s true that mbaqanga and quan họ developed
separately and have little in common musically, then it wouldn’t make sense to lump them into the same category.
Choice B is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical
traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. A difference in popularity
doesn’t necessarily mean that the two musical traditions shouldn’t be categorized together: instead, we need to know if the
music itself is similar or different. Choice C is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need
evidence that these musical traditions are so different from each other that they should not fall into the same category. This
choice doesn’t do that. Choice D is incorrect. If true, this would actually weaken the claim. Zheng thinks it’s reductive or
oversimplifying to put distinct musical traditions into a single category. But if mbaqanga and quan họ are similar to each
other, then it would make sense to put them in the same category.',

Does this difference matter? In an experiment, researchers asked one group of participants to touch a mug and a toy, while

for the items. People who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than were people who

    'Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that “people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money

may make it seem more valuable to a shopper.
Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss how much people spend each month, so there’s not much basis for this claim.
Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people “willing to pay much more money” for it, we might
predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper. Choice C is
incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss what retailers “should charge,” so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, the
study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can
touch it. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss products that are only available online, so there’s not much basis for

has more than 90,000 artworks. It goes on to explain that images of a subset of these works can be viewed online, such as
an image of Armajani’s drawing Mississippi Delta. The text then presents a student’s claim that online images of art can
increase the number of people who experience the work. If more people view Armajani’s drawing online than they do in

this finding would most directly support the claim because, if it were true, more people would view Mississippi Delta online

millennium CE, was characterized by a sparse, widely distributed population and little intervention in the surrounding

sensing technology that enabled them to create three-dimensional images of the jungle-covered landscape from above, and

    'Scientists studying Mars long thought the history of its crust was relatively simple. One reason for this is that geologic and
climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense
volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet’s surface. A study led by Valerie
Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths
detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on
Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of
silica, Payré concluded that ______

Copper had been mined in the US for thousands of years, but large-scale commercial mining of copper took off starting in
the late 1800s. This was due to several factors. Technological advancements in the mining industry led to improvements in
the production of copper. This helped the country keep up with the growing number of people wanting to buy copper starting
in the 1890s. At the same time, the growth of the railroad system made the transportation of copper in large batches much
easier. Several states saw rapid growth in the production of this resource, for example: ______

    'The alpaca was domesticated by Indigenous peoples in the Andes about 7,000 years ago. But which wild species did it
descend from, the vicuña or guanaco? A research team led by Ruiwen Fan may have solved the mystery, concluding that the
alpaca is the domesticated form of the vicuña but that the modern alpaca gets only 64 percent of its genetic material from
its wild ancestor. The rest comes from the domesticated llama. The llama, meanwhile, gets 95.5 percent of its genetic
material from its own wild ancestor, the guanaco, and the rest from the alpaca. The llama and alpaca apparently interbred
widely for only a handful of generations between 400 and 600 years ago. Assuming that the findings of Fan’s team are valid,

C. the period of interbreeding resulted in a greater genetic difference between alpacas and their wild ancestors than

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents the inference that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the
genetic material of alpacas. The text states that modern alpacas get only 64 percent of their genetic material from their wild
ancestor (the vicuña), while llamas get 95.5 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the guanaco). These
data imply that relative to llamas, alpacas have experienced a much greater genetic shift away from their wild ancestors (36
percent of their genetic material derives from another source, compared to 4.5 percent of llamas’ genetic material).
Moreover, the text establishes that the remainder of alpacas’ genetic material derives from llamas, and the remainder of
llamas’ genetic material derives from alpacas, reflecting a period of interbreeding. Taken together, these details support the
inference that the period of interbreeding had a more significant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of
llamas, thereby reducing the percentage of alpacas’ genetic material that derives from wild ancestors and placing alpacas at
a greater remove from these ancestors.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about genetic diversity within modern llama and alpaca
populations. While the text discusses the percentage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited from its wild
ancestor and from interbreeding, it does not address the level of genetic variation within each species. Therefore, it isn’t
logical to infer that modern llama populations have a greater degree of genetic diversity than modern alpaca populations do.
Choice B is incorrect because it contradicts the chronology presented in the text. The text states that alpacas were
domesticated about 7,000 years ago, but the interbreeding with llamas occurred "between 400 and 600 years ago." The
genetic mixing happened thousands of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not provide details
about what the process of domestication might entail. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that llama genetic material was
introduced during the domestication process of alpacas. Choice D is incorrect because though the text notes that guanacos
and vicuñas contributed to the genetic material of alpacas and llamas, it only discusses alpacas’ and llamas’ genetic
composition. Therefore, the text does not support the inference that modern populations of guanacos and vicuñas would
likely show traces of ancient interbreeding.',

    'In their 2022 paper, Christos Dimopoulos et al., having granted that the existence of antigravity—in which antimatter and
matter repel rather than attract each other—lacked affirmative experimental support, rightly argued that such antigravity was
worth considering on theoretical grounds given that evidence against it was similarly lacking. But a 2023 report by an
international team of researchers details the first direct ballistic observations of antihydrogen atoms under gravity inside a
CERN particle accelerator.  Corresponding most closely to predictions under gravitational attraction, these observations were
thoroughly inconsistent with antigravity.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Antihydrogen ballistics observations were conducted at CERN to test specific conclusions about antigravity presented in
the 2022 paper by Dimopoulos et al.
B. Although theoreticians were justified in studying antigravity before the release of the 2023 report, the report’s findings
suggest that the rationale for theoretical consideration offered in the 2022 paper by Dimopoulos et al. is no longer
applicable.
C. The theoretical approach represented in the 2022 paper by Dimopoulos et al. assumed that unambiguous proof of
antigravity would not be achievable, but the results in the 2023 report undermine that assumption.
D. Before 2023, researchers’ inordinate focus on theoretical considerations hindered the development of the experimental
regimen for direct antihydrogen ballistics observations.',

    'Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by acknowledging
that in 2022, Dimopoulos et al. were justified in arguing for antigravity on theoretical grounds because although there was no
experimental evidence supporting its existence at that time, there was no evidence contradicting its existence either. The
text then introduces the 2023 report describing an experiment that produced observations "thoroughly inconsistent with
antigravity." Thus, the main idea is that while the study of antigravity was theoretically justified before the 2023 report (due to
lack of evidence against it), the report’s findings undermine the rationale for such theoretical consideration since there is
now evidence against this hypothetical phenomenon.
Choice A is incorrect. Although antihydrogen ballistics observations were conducted at CERN, the text provides no evidence
that they were conducted to test conclusions in Dimopoulos et al.’s 2022 paper. Rather, the text presents the 2023 report as
new evidence that contradicts the existence of the hypothetical phenomenon that Dimopoulos et al. had considered. Choice
C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Dimopoulos et al. assumed that unambiguous proof of antigravity would
be unattainable. Rather, the text states that they argued antigravity was worth considering theoretically because evidence
against it was lacking at that time. At the same time, the results in the 2023 report do not undermine but strengthen the idea
that the proof of antigravity might not be achievable. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there was
an "inordinate focus on theoretical considerations" before 2023 or that such a focus hindered the development of
experimental methods. In fact, the text describes Dimopoulos et al.’s position regarding the theoretical consideration of
antigravity as "rightly argued," indicating approval of their approach given the absence of experimental evidence at that time.',

    'Choice D is the best answer. Churchill’s play was influenced by Brecht’s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather

the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion)
and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.
Choice A is incorrect. The passage mentions that Churchill was influenced by Brecht’s belief that plays should provoke
audience members “to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted
onstage,” so there’s no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters’ beliefs and actions.
Choice B is incorrect. Reflecting on things that aren’t related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn’t “engage audiences in an
interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism.” That creates a confusing contradiction. Choice C is incorrect. No mention is

It has been hypothesized that since birds can dissipate excess heat through their bills, bill size should increase with habitat
temperature. To evaluate this hypothesis for a 2021 study, Charlotte Probst and colleagues gathered data on mean bill
surface area of species of North American thrashers (genus: Toxostoma) as well as on climate conditions of the birds’ native
habitats. Based on their data, Probst and colleagues concluded that the hypothesis was not fully supported.
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion?
A. Although the Bendire’s thrasher has one of the smallest mean bill surface areas of the birds included in the table, its
habitat has one of the lowest mean maximum temperatures in the warmest month and one of the lowest mean minimum
temperatures in the coldest month.
B. Although the Cozumel thrasher has the second greatest mean bill surface area of the birds included in the table, its
habitat’s mean temperature in the warmest month is significantly higher than that of the other birds’ habitats.
C. Of the birds included in the table, the brown thrasher has the smallest mean bill surface area and the habitat with the
lowest mean minimum temperature in the coldest month, while the long-billed thrasher has the second-largest mean bill
surface area and the habitat with the second-highest mean minimum temperature in the coldest month.
D. Of the birds included in the table, the ocellated thrasher has the largest mean bill surface area and the habitat with the
lowest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month, while the Bendire’s thrasher has the second smallest mean
bill surface area and the habitat with the highest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month.',

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support Probst and colleagues’
conclusion about the hypothesis regarding the relationship between birds’ bill size and habitat temperature. The text states
that although it has been hypothesized that birds’ bill size should increase with habitat temperature (an adaptation that
reflects the fact that birds can release excess heat through their bills), Probst and colleagues concluded after studying mean
bill surface area in North American thrashers that this hypothesis was not fully supported. In other words, Probst and
colleagues did not observe the predicted positive relationship between mean bill surface area and habitat temperature in the
thrashers they studied. The data in the table about the ocellated thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion
because this species has the greatest mean bill surface area (3.26 cm), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum
temperature in the warmest month (27.56°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, species such as the ocellated thrasher
that have colder habitats would likely also have smaller bills. Similarly, the data about the Bendire’s thrasher support Probst
and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the second-smallest mean bill surface area (1.98 cm), yet its habitat
has the highest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (36.57°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, the
Bendire’s thrasher and other species with warmer habitats would also have larger bills. Because data in the table show that
the ocellated thrasher and the Bendire’s thrasher have the opposite or near opposite of the hypothesized relationship
between bill size and habitat temperature, these examples support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion that this hypothesis
isn’t fully supported.
Choice A is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Bendire’s thrasher has the second-smallest
mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean
minimum temperature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (rather than the lowest) mean maximum
temperature in the warmest month. Moreover, the data about this species’ bill surface area and mean minimum temperature
suggest that smaller bills are associated with colder habitats, supporting rather than challenging the hypothesis that bill size
increases with habitat temperature. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the
Cozumel thrasher has the second-greatest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table, its habitat’s
mean maximum temperature in the warmest month is not "significantly higher" than the mean maximum temperatures of the
other habitats. On the contrary, the mean maximum temperature of the Cozumel thrasher’s habitat is lower than that
observed for the habitats of both the Bendire’s thrasher and the long-billed thrasher. Choice C is incorrect because it
misrepresents the data in the table. Although this choice accurately describes the brown thrasher’s mean bill surface area
and habitat temperature, it incorrectly states that the long-billed thrasher has the second-largest (rather than the third-
largest) mean bill surface area of the species included. In addition, instead of revealing a lack of support for the hypothesis
that bill size increases with habitat temperature, the data in this choice broadly reflect the hypothesized relationship.',

    'Algae living within the tissues of corals play a critical role in keeping corals, and the marine ecosystems they are part of,
thriving. Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event
of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the
bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to
recolonize the corals.
What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors?
A. These corals have likely been subjected to stressful environmental conditions.

After a volcanic eruption spilled lava into North Pacific Ocean waters, a dramatic increase of diatoms (a kind of
phytoplankton) near the surface occurred. Scientists assumed the diatoms were thriving on nutrients such as phosphate
from the lava, but analysis showed these nutrients weren’t present near the surface in forms diatoms can consume.
However, there was an abundance of usable nitrate, a nutrient usually found in much deeper water and almost never found in
lava. Microbial oceanographer Sonya Dyhrman and colleagues believe that as the lava plunged nearly 300 meters below the
surface it dislodged pockets of this nutrient, releasing it to float upward, given that ______

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the costs of studies. The text
indicates that HILDA is a longitudinal study—it involves repeated observations over a long time—and that the "need for years
of data collection" is what causes it and most other longitudinal studies to have high costs. The text then contrasts such
studies with more straightforward studies, using the example of a fitness study that wants only to find out how many regular
exercisers in a particular location do weight training, that may not demand a large budget. The contrast emphasized in the
text most directly suggests that the fitness study may cost less than a study like HILDA because the fitness study aims only
to determine a current percentage and thus can be completed well without extending data collection over years.
Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly introduces the idea of a less expensive, straightforward fitness study as a
contrast to many longitudinal studies that, like HILDA, have high costs because they require data collection over many years.
The fitness study is described as trying merely to gather information about a current behavior (how many regular exercisers
do weight training) rather than track trends over time, which suggests that costs could remain low because expensive
longitudinal methods would not be needed, not because they would be suitable. Choice B is incorrect because the idea that
HILDA researchers could easily add questions to their study might be relevant to the costs of that survey but would be
completely irrelevant as an explanation for why an unrelated fitness study may not need a large budget; the studies have no
direct bearing on each other. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that HILDA involves more people than necessary would
be relevant to the costs of that survey but would be completely irrelevant as an explanation for why an unrelated fitness
study may not need a large budget; the studies have no direct bearing on each other.',

    'In the “language nest” model of education, Indigenous children learn the language of their people by using it as the medium
of instruction and socialization at pre-K or elementary levels. In their 2016 study of a school in an Anishinaabe community in
Ontario, Canada, scholars Lindsay Morcom and Stephanie Roy (who are Anishinaabe themselves) found that the model not
only imparted fluency in the Anishinaabe language but also enhanced students’ pride in Anishinaabe culture overall. Given
these positive effects, Morcom and Roy predict that the model increases the probability that as adults, former students of
the school will transmit the language to younger generations in their community.
Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the researchers’ prediction?
A. Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel roughly the same degree of cultural pride as the former students of
the school feel.
B. After transferring to the school, new students experience an increase in both fluency and academic performance overall.
C. As adults, former students of the school are just as likely to continue living in their community as individuals who didn’t
attend the school.
D. As they complete secondary and higher education, former students of the school experience no loss of fluency or
cultural pride.',

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ prediction about the
language nest model of education. The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of
education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model—which is used with students during pre-K or
elementary school—increased students’ fluency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The
researchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be
more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride
after finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they
know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the
researchers predict.
Choice A is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel approximately the same
degree of cultural pride as those adults who did attend wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will
be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This finding would identify a similarity between the groups
rather than a factor that might make former students more likely than other adults to transmit the language to younger
people. Choice B is incorrect because finding that new students experience increased performance in language fluency and
academics would suggest that the school has a positive effect on students when they attended but wouldn’t reveal anything
about those students’ later actions as adults (such as their likelihood of sharing their knowledge with younger generations).
Choice C is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who attended the school are equally likely to stay in the
community as adults who didn’t attend the school wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be
more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This finding would identify a similarity between the groups

    'Dutch painters in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often showed tables filled with large wheels of cheese or carved
shards of butter. Some art historians, noting that dairy products were a major component of the Dutch diet, interpret these
depictions as reflections of everyday Dutch eating habits. However, a group of researchers recently reviewed hundreds of
food-related paintings and found that lemons—which could only be acquired in the Netherlands at great cost, since they had
to be imported from warmer climates—feature in Dutch paintings of the period more than three times as frequently as dairy
products do, thereby casting doubt on the idea that ______

doubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets.
Choice A is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a "major component of the
Dutch diet," while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than
dairy products. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention painters from other countries, so there’s no basis to
make this inference. Choice D is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests that Dutch painters do have reasons for depicting foods

A sociology student is reading an essay on the median age of first marriage in Western countries throughout the twentieth
century. The author of the essay cites factors common to these countries that the author believes caused an increase in the
median age of first marriage, such as new technologies that shortened the time needed for domestic chores, making two-
person households less necessary and living alone more viable. The student asserts that beyond these factors there must
be additional ones specific to particular Western countries that influenced the increase of age at first marriage.
Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph that support the student’s assertion?
A. Between 1970 and 2000, the median age of first marriage rose more sharply for men in England and Wales than it did for
men in the United States.
B. In England and Wales, the median age of first marriage was consistently higher for men than for women between 1900
and 2000, but this was not always the case in the United States.
C. The median age of first marriage for men in England and Wales was lower in 1970 than in 1950 or 1990.

    'Barchester Towers is an 1857 novel by Anthony Trollope. In the novel, Trollope’s portrayal of Dr. Proudie underscores the

    'Choice B is the best answer. In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as "fondly flatter[ing] himself" that he has gifts that
"must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice." In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame
and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support.
Choice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially
flattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not "proved," it implies that he is actually dim-
witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it
doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D
is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own
abilities, which is what the claim focuses on.',

    'Boldly mixing elements of poetry, fiction, drama, philosophy, and manifesto, Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi creates

    'Several studies of sediment (e.g., dirt, pieces of rock, etc.) in streams have shown an inverse correlation between sediment
grain size and downstream distance from the primary sediment source, suggesting that stream length has a sorting effect
on sediment. In a study of sediment sampled at more than a dozen sites in Alpine streams, however, geologists Camille Litty
and Fritz Schlunegger found that cross-site variations in grain size were not associated with differences in downstream
distance, though they did not conclude that downstream distance is irrelevant to grain size. Rather, they concluded that
sediment influx in these streams may have been sufficiently spatially diffuse to prevent the typical sorting effect from being
observed.

A. The streams regularly experience portions of their banks collapsing into the water at multiple points upstream of the
sampling sites.
B. The streams contain several types of sediment that are not typically found in streams where the sorting effect has been

multiple points, then sediment is getting into the water at those various points. This supports the conclusion that the inflow
of sediment is very spread out.

“spatially diffuse,” meaning spread out over a large area. The type of sediment wouldn’t have an impact on the conclusions.
Choice C is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. It doesn’t say anything about the influx of sediment being

    'Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to exemplify the researcher’s claim—
namely, that the duration of ice on some lakes has declined between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s. According to the

Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on only one period of time (the early 1980s). Thus, the data it cites don’t support the
researcher’s claim, which compares the duration of surface ice across two specific periods of time (the early 1980s and the

    'Choice C is the best answer because it effectively completes the text’s discussion of Moses and colleagues’ analysis of
changes in Neptune’s temperature by using data from the table to identify the source of the earliest example of spectroscopy
data included in this analysis. The text indicates that Moses and colleagues analyzed infrared imaging and spectroscopy
data about Neptune obtained in different years by various instruments. The table lists the observatories where these
instruments are housed, the type of data each instrument collected (infrared imaging or spectroscopy), and the years in
which the instruments’ observations were made. According to the table, only two of these instruments obtained
spectroscopy data: VISIR at the European Southern Observatory, which made its observations in 2006, and TEXES at the
Gemini Observatory, which made its observations in later years (2007 and 2019). Although two other instruments are also
included in the table, they obtained infrared imaging data, not spectroscopy data. Therefore, the earliest example of
spectroscopy data included in the researchers’ analysis is the data obtained by VISIR at the European Southern Observatory
in 2006.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the table indicates that TEXES at the Gemini Observatory collected spectroscopy data in
2007 and 2019, the table also indicates that this type of data was collected in 2006 by VISIR at the European Southern
Observatory. Because the VISIR data were collected in the previous year, the data obtained in 2007 by TEXES are not the
earliest example of spectroscopy data included in Moses and team’s analysis of Neptune’s temperature. Choice B is
incorrect because the table indicates that T-ReCS at the Gemini Observatory collected infrared imaging data, not
spectroscopy data. T-ReCS therefore cannot be the source of the earliest example of spectroscopy data that is included in
Moses and colleagues’ analysis of Neptune’s temperature. Additionally, the T-ReCS data were collected in 2007, meaning
that these data were obtained later than any type of data collected in 2006. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table
indicates that data from LWS at the W.M. Keck Observatory were obtained in 2003, making these data the earliest example
of any type of data included in the analysis, the table also indicates that LWS collected infrared imaging data, not
spectroscopy data. LWS therefore cannot be the source of the earliest example of spectroscopy data included in Moses and

Choice B is incorrect. We only know about geological processes at the Acasta Gneiss Complex, so we do not have
information to make inferences about geological processes in general. Also, notice that the rocks dated to 4.02 bya were
found to still be formed in a plume setting, so the transition must have happened after this time. Choice C is incorrect.

strong feeling, like the impulse to tap one’s foot or dance. The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however,

downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in

    'Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants were “more than seven times likelier to characterize the

may play a crucial role in giving a song swing.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers “synchronized the offbeats” in the modified
songs, they also “delayed the downbeats” in those songs. Because we can’t disentangle whether it was the synchronized
offbeats, the delayed downbeats, or the combination of both that increased the song’s swing, we don’t have enough
information to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention whether or not it’s difficult for a jazz

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Dumas Gálvez and
colleagues’ conclusion that the venom produced by the scorpion species Centruroides granosus helps mitigate, or reduce,
risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success. According to the text, Gálvez and colleagues found that the
venom used by C. granosus both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, a pathogen that, if ingested by C.
granosus, would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that E. coli is commonly found in
species preyed on by C. granosus and, moreover, can withstand C. granosus’s digestive juices after ingestion, this would
suggest that C. granosus likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize E. coli to make E. coli-infected prey safe for
consumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, C. granosus’s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen’s
growth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for C. granosus against E. coli that its digestive system
wouldn’t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it
mitigates risk during feeding.
Choice A is incorrect because a finding that E. coli doesn’t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for C. granosus even when
venom isn’t used would weaken rather than strengthen Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that a particular form of venom
production spread in C. granosus in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that E.
coli isn’t actually a risk to C. granosus when consuming prey. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that C. granosus can
detect and avoid consuming E. coli-infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production
is the primary factor that reduces C. granosus’s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary
pressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn’t clearly support the conclusion that C.
granosus’s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is
incorrect because Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion focuses on C. granosus venom in relation to the risk of E. coli, and a
finding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don’t pose a
risk if consumed, wouldn’t be relevant to the conclusion that C. granosus’s particular form of venom production spread in the

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion about a
trade-off in growing shorter varieties of corn. The text explains that plant specialists are working to develop shorter corn
varieties in an effort to improve yields. The text points out that although greater height in corn plants can lead to more ears
of corn per plant, it also makes the stalks more likely to be damaged by strong winds before there is a chance to harvest the
corn. This presents a clear trade-off between potential yield (taller plants producing more ears per plant) and harvest
reliability (shorter plants surviving until harvest time). Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that shorter corn
varieties, while possibly producing fewer ears per plant, would be more likely to survive until harvest time. This survival
advantage would result in improved yields of harvested corn because more plants would remain intact, thus offsetting the
potential reduction in ears per shorter plant.
Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, greater height makes cornstalks vulnerable to snapping or being uprooted in
strong winds, implying that taller plants—not shorter ones—have greater stability problems. The text provides no basis for
inferring that shorter corn varieties would be more likely to be uprooted due to corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the
opposite relationship between height and stability. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about
the land requirements of either shorter corn varieties or shorter wheat and rice varieties, much less make any comparisons.
The text mentions that plant breeders in the 1950s and ’60s created shorter varieties of wheat and rice with improved yields
and that researchers are now exploring shorter corn varieties, but it doesn’t compare land-use requirements of these crops.
Choice D is incorrect because the idea that shorter cornstalks would yield more ears of corn would contradict the
relationship between height and corn production described in the text. The text explicitly states that greater height allows
individual plants to produce more ears of corn, which suggests that shorter varieties would produce fewer ears per plant, not
more. The text therefore provides no basis for concluding that shorter varieties would begin developing more ears than the
taller varieties currently do.',

cultivation practice mentioned in Kwakwaka’wakw people’s songs was efficacious when implemented, it gives no indication
that people other than the Kwakwaka’wakw adopted that practice. Choice C is incorrect because the text provides no
information about the archaeological record as it pertains to Sakha and Kaluli songs and doesn’t suggest that there is less
corroboration of practices described in those songs than there is of the clam cultivation practice described in
Kwakwaka’wakw songs. The Sakha and Kaluli songs are mentioned early in the text only as examples of Indigenous songs
that contain ecological knowledge. Choice D is incorrect because archaeological evidence that clam size and abundance
both increased when Kwakwaka’wakw ancestors implemented intertidal terraced gardens provides information only about
the past use of that method and doesn’t suggest anything about present practices. The text indicates that knowledge of a
past clam cultivation method is maintained in Kwakwaka’wakw songs but doesn’t indicate whether modern Kwakwaka’wakw
people use that or other fishing and farming practices used by their ancestors.',

    'Laura Mulvey has theorized that in narrative film, shots issuing from a protagonist’s point of view compel viewers to identify
with the character. Such identification is heightened by “invisible editing,” or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts
between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view
shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist. Consider, for example, the attic scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s
The Birds, a conspicuously edited sequence of tens of shots, few of which correspond to the protagonist’s point of view.
According to Mulvey’s logic, this scene should affect viewers by ______

protagonist.
Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention viewers’ awareness of artifice (i.e., camera trickery) in films, so there’s
no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the director at all, so there’s no basis for this
inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss whether a film’s “stylistic attributes” may distract viewers from

In tomato plants, herbivory induces defensive production of jasmonic acid, while microbial infection induces defensive
production of salicylic acid; plants also emit airborne chemicals to initiate the appropriate defense in nearby tomato plants.
Researchers investigated the poor resistance tomato plants show to whitefly herbivory by exposing some plants to airborne
chemicals from whitefly-free plants and others to airborne chemicals from whitefly-infested plants, then infesting both
groups of plants with whiteflies. The researchers concluded that whiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that
cause other tomato plants to preferentially defend against microbial infection even when under herbivorous attack.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion about
whitefly-induced defenses in tomato plants. According to the text, tomato plants produce airborne chemicals that prompt
nearby tomato plants to increase their production of appropriate defensive chemicals, such as jasmonic acid in response to
herbivory and salicylic acid in response to microbial infection. The text goes on to indicate that researchers concluded that
whiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that cause nearby plants to defend against microbial infection instead of
herbivory from whiteflies. The graph shows that control tomato plants (plants that weren’t exposed to any chemicals from
nearby tomato plants and weren’t subsequently infested with whiteflies) produced about 140 nanograms of jasmonic acid
per gram of dry weight and about 120 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, which indicates the baseline levels
of these defensive chemicals in tomato plants. The graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants
produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when subsequently infested by whiteflies, which is
more than the amount produced by the control plants. This suggests that when infested with whiteflies, tomato plants that
weren’t previously exposed to air from nearby whitefly-infested plants begin producing higher levels of jasmonic acid to
defend against the infestation. Finally, the graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants and then
subsequently infested by whiteflies produced approximately 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight (which
is less than control plants did) and approximately 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more
than control plants did). This suggests that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit chemical signals that decrease nearby
plants’ defenses against whitefly herbivory relative to baseline levels and redirect their defenses toward microbial infection,
thereby supporting the researchers’ conclusion that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit airborne chemical signals that
induce nearby plants to preferentially defend against microbes even when experiencing herbivory from whiteflies.
Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph shows that tomato plants exposed to whitefly-infested plants produced less
jasmonic acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight vs. about 175 nanograms
of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight), and although this might suggest that those plants are therefore better defended
against microbial attack than against herbivory, this wouldn’t be sufficient to conclude that this is the case: without reference
to the relative levels of defensive chemicals produced by the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be
impossible to conclude that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants either induces or diminishes these plants’ defenses
to different kinds of threats. Furthermore, the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced
about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry
weight, not that they produced the same amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the
data in the graph. The graph shows that plants in all three conditions produced both jasmonic and salicylic acid, not that
plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produce no jasmonic acid at all. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph
shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produced about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of
dry weight when infested, which is less than the amount produced by control plants (about 140 nanograms per gram of dry
weight), and although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms
of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested (which is more than the amount produced by control plants) and
about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than the approximately 120 nanograms per
gram of dry weight produced by control plants), this wouldn’t support the researchers’ conclusion that plants exposed to air
from whitefly-infested plants preferentially defend against microbial infection—that is, that they increase their levels of
salicylic acid and decrease their levels of jasmonic acid relative to control plants. Rather, the data would suggest that
exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants reduces plants’ defenses against herbivory, but these data wouldn’t indicate
that whiteflies induce plants to redirect their defenses to guard against microbial infection. Furthermore, the data concerning
plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants merely indicate that these plants increase their defenses against both
herbivory and microbial infection when infested by whiteflies.',

Some whale species practice lunge feeding, in which they lunge toward prey with their mouths open at wide angles, collect
the prey and the surrounding water, and then filter out the water through baleen plates in their mouths. Although the volume
of water engulfed increases with whales’ body length, the surface area of whales’ baleen plates, which influences the rate at
which water can be filtered, does not increase with body length to the same degree, which helps explain why ______
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A. minke whales and humpback whales show similar average filter times.

Choice A is incorrect. The table shows that minke whales take an average of 8.88 seconds to filter engulfed water, while
humpback whales take an average of 17.12 seconds to complete the same task. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t
reflect the claim about baleen plates. The claim explains why whales of differing lengths take different amounts of time to
filter engulfed water. This choice doesn’t compare whales of different lengths, and it focuses on the number of lunges, which
isn’t shown to be relevant to filter time. Choice D is incorrect. The table shows that blue whales average 4.02 lunges per dive,

passes genetic material to an unrelated species. In a 2022 study, herpetologist Atsushi Kurabayashi and his team

    'Philosophers note that many people have an intuitive sense that while we ought not to lie, there may be circumstances in
which lying is permissible. If this intuition is correct and we lack an inviolable duty to speak truthfully, what grounds
opposition to lying in the first place? Japa Pallikkathayil has advanced one answer by appealing to a duty to respect others’
agential interests: the possession of false beliefs constrains agency, and thus we ought not to impede the formation of true
beliefs unless doing so prevents a greater constraint on someone’s agency or an otherwise impermissible end.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. One potential means of justifying opposition to lying is Pallikkathayil’s argument that we have an obligation to respect
other people’s agency that entails a commitment to truthfulness except in certain circumstances.
B. Many people have an intuitive sense that lying is permissible in some circumstances but lack a principled way to identify
those circumstances, and Pallikkathayil’s argument may provide a means of resolving that problem.
C. Pallikkathayil’s argument suggests that if we have a duty to respect other people’s agential interests and if possession of
false beliefs constrains agency, then we have an inviolable duty to speak truthfully.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by noting a common
intuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which raises the question of what is the reason for being against lying.
The text then presents Pallikkathayil’s answer to this question: we have a duty to respect others’ agential interests (that is,
we have an obligation to allow people to exercise their free will in order to best serve their own ends), false beliefs constrain
agency (the implication here being that people who are deceived about what is true are impeded in acting in their own best
interests), and so we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliberately deceive a person) unless
doing so prevents a greater limitation on someone’s agency or prevents some otherwise impermissible end (for example, it
might be morally permissible to lie to someone in the rare circumstance where a false belief would lead a person to act in
their own best interest, and where they would not do so if they knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that
Pallikkathayil offers a potential justification for opposing lying based on respecting agency, while still allowing for exceptions
in specific circumstances.
Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t focus on people’s lack of a principled way to identify circumstances where
lying is permissible or indicate that Pallikkathayil’s argument resolves this specific problem. Rather, the text presents
Pallikkathayil’s argument that lies limit agency but may be permitted in very specific situations (to prevent a greater
limitation on someone’s agency or an otherwise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible arguments about
why lies are undesirable but sometimes permissible. Choice C is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text.
Pallikkathayil’s argument, as described in the text, wouldn’t lead to an "inviolable duty to speak truthfully." On the contrary, the
text explicitly states that Pallikkathayil’s position is that interfering with people developing accurate beliefs is wrong, except
when such interference prevents either a more significant limitation on someone’s agency or an outcome that would be
unacceptable for other reasons. This indicates that Pallikkathayil’s argument allows for some exceptions to the duty to
speak truthfully, making it not inviolable. Choice D is incorrect because Pallikkathayil’s argument doesn’t suggest that if it is
permissible to lie in at least some circumstances, then it is unclear whether there are good reasons for opposing lying in any
circumstances. Instead, the text presents Pallikkathayil as offering a specific ground for opposing lying (respecting others’
ability to act in their own best interests) while qualifying that assertion by presenting a situation in which lying might
sometimes be morally permissible.',

treatment (see how all four points are very close together at -4 minutes, meaning four minutes before treatment). Choice B is

    'Neurobiologists Laura Cuaya, Raúl Hernández-Pérez, and colleagues investigated the language detection abilities of
eighteen dogs. The researchers monitored the brain activity of Joey (an Australian shepherd), Mini (a mixed breed), and
other dogs while the animals listened to three recordings: one of The Little Prince being read in Spanish, the second in
Hungarian, and a third made up of short, randomly selected fragments of the first two, scrambled so that they didn’t
resemble human speech. Each dog was familiar with either Spanish or Hungarian, but not both. The team concluded that
differences in dogs’ anatomical features may affect their ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech.
Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the team’s conclusion?
A. Long-headed dogs accustomed to hearing Spanish tended to show more brain activity when hearing Spanish than long-
headed dogs accustomed to hearing Hungarian showed when hearing Hungarian.
B. Compared with shorter-headed dogs, longer-headed dogs showed a greater difference in brain activity when hearing
either Spanish or Hungarian than when hearing the scrambled recording.
C. The pattern of brain activity that long-headed dogs showed when hearing the scrambled recording was different from the

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the research team’s
conclusion about anatomical features and speech detection in dogs. The text explains that a team of researchers monitored
the brain activity of dogs while the dogs listened to three recordings: one of spoken Spanish, one of spoken Hungarian, and
one of scrambled fragments that weren’t recognizable as human speech. The text then states that the team concluded that
differences in dogs’ anatomical features may affect their ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. The finding that
longer-headed dogs exhibited a greater difference in brain activity when listening to the speech recordings (in Spanish or
Hungarian) versus the nonspeech (scrambled) recording compared with shorter-headed dogs would establish an
association between an anatomical feature (head length) and responses (as measured by brain activity) to speech versus
nonspeech. This observed relationship between head length and brain activity patterns during exposure to speech and
nonspeech would support the team’s conclusion.
Choice A is incorrect because it describes a finding about dogs’ responses (as indicated by brain activity) to hearing their
respective familiar languages rather than dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech, which is what the team’s
conclusion specifically addresses. Moreover, this finding pertains to only one anatomical type (long-headed dogs), so it
wouldn’t support the conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech.
Choice C is incorrect because it describes a finding involving a comparison between long-headed dogs listening to
nonspeech and short-headed dogs listening to speech, which wouldn’t provide enough information to support the
researchers’ conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. To
support that conclusion, the finding would need to show how dogs with different anatomical features (for example, long-
headed and short-headed dogs) respond to recordings of speech as well as recordings of nonspeech. Choice D is incorrect
because it describes a finding about dogs’ ability to distinguish between a familiar language and an unfamiliar one, not
between speech and nonspeech. While this finding does compare dogs with different anatomical features (longer-headed
vs. shorter-headed ones), it focuses on language recognition (Spanish vs. Hungarian) rather than the ability to distinguish
speech from nonspeech, which is what the team’s conclusion specifically addresses.',

    'Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European
diplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included "a reassurance to the United States," and made implicit

inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although there’s an implicit reference to European governments when the passage
discusses how the declaration was written in French, "which was used throughout Europe as the language of international

haul flights (flights of 50 to 210 minutes, from takeoff to landing) to high-speed rail trips. Planes travel faster than trains, but

B. rail systems may need to schedule additional trains for these routes.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, many of
Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than
realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his
work in honor of Ida B. Wells as “using mainly flowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized flame.” Thus, the main idea
is that Hunt often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.
Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt’s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there
is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose
the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important
historical figure; Arachne is a “mythical character.” Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt’s
style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt’s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart,
they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt’s style haven’t

Weight of Three Aerial Robots
Ultra-Fast Robot Hand
Permanent Magnet Hand
Yale Model T
Aerial robots vary considerably in their holding force; the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand, for example, has a holding force of 56
newtons, more than twice that of the Permanent Magnet Hand and more than four times that of the Yale Model T. Since an
aerial robot must lift its own weight along with its cargo, engineer Jiawei Meng and colleagues used a ratio of each robot’s
holding force to the robot’s weight to calculate payload capacity, with higher ratios corresponding to greater capacity,
concluding that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.
Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion?
A. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T each weigh more than 450 grams.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the
Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is
calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload
capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T.
Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than
the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding
force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the
graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the
information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than

Choice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T
weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand
has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the
two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale
Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’
conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes
a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the
Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-Fast Robot
Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force
than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover,  information about the
Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot
Hand and the Yale Model T.',

    'Jan Gimsa, Robert Sleigh, and Ulrike Gimsa have hypothesized that the sail-like structure running down the back of the
dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus improved the animal’s success in underwater pursuits of prey species capable of making

Radha Aunty, who was the youngest in my father’s family, had left for America four years ago when I was three, and I could
not remember what she looked like. I went into the corridor to look at the family photographs that were hung there. But all
the pictures were old ones, taken when Radha Aunty was a baby or young girl. Try as I might, I couldn’t get an idea of what

All other things being equal, the larger a wind turbine’s rotor diameter (the diameter of the imaginary circle swept by the
turbine’s rotating blades), the greater amount of energy the turbine can generate. In a research paper on wind power, a
student claims that in the United States, the amount of energy generated per newly installed turbine increased substantially
between 2011 and 2021.
Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the student’s claim?
A. The percentage of newly installed turbines with rotor diameters greater than 130 meters increased every year between
2011 and 2021.
B. In 2011, nearly 80% of turbines installed had rotor diameters of less than 100 meters, whereas only a little more than 20%
of turbines installed that year had rotor diameters of 100–115 meters.

    'Jürgen Kocka and other historians of capitalism rarely discuss domestic capitalism in Africa before the period of European
colonization, implicitly presenting capitalism as external to and imposed on Africa. Crislayne Alfagali and other Africanist
scholars have shown, however, that in parts of Africa, returns-focused investment, the establishment of open markets for
wage labor, and other features of capitalism predated colonization. One reason for this discrepancy is that historians of
capitalism tend to focus on longitudinal economic data drawn from archival records, which do not exist for much of
precolonial Africa.

A. They likely make use of different types of evidence than historians of capitalism typically rely on.
B. They likely differ from historians of capitalism in the methods they use to derive longitudinal economic data from archival

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that is supported
by the text. The last sentence of the text explains that historians of capitalism generally rely on a type of data that requires
"archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa." Nevertheless, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars have
demonstrated that features of capitalism including "returns-focused investment,...open markets for wage labor, and other
features of capitalism" existed in parts of Africa before colonization. Because archival records typically used by historians of
capitalism aren′t available for precolonial Africa, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars of precolonial capitalism in Africa
likely used atypical sources for their studies.
Choice B is incorrect because the text states that archival records containing longitudinal economic data "do not exist for
much of precolonial Africa." If these records don’t exist for precolonial Africa, then Alfagali and other Africanist scholars
couldn’t derive data from them by any method. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alfagali and other
Africanist scholars define capitalism differently than other historians of capitalism do. On the contrary, the text simply
asserts that specific features they found, such as "returns-focused investment [and] open markets for wage labor," are
"features of capitalism," which implies scholarly agreement that these activities are capitalist in nature. Choice D is incorrect
because the text doesn’t indicate any effects of capitalism in Africa, positive or negative. Rather, the text explains why
precolonial Africa has been omitted from mainstream histories of capitalism and presents work by Alfagali and other
Africanist scholars that challenges and corrects the historical record of precolonial capitalism.',

    'Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Héctor Tobar has built a multifaceted career as both a journalist and an author of short stories
and novels. In an essay about Tobar’s work, a student claims that Tobar blends his areas of expertise by applying journalism
techniques to his creation of works of fiction.
Which quotation from a literary critic best supports the student’s claim?
A. “For one novel, an imagined account of a real person’s global travels, Tobar approached his subject like a reporter,
interviewing people the man had met along the way and researching the man’s own writings.”
B. “Tobar got his start as a volunteer for El Tecolote, a community newspaper in San Francisco, and wrote for newspapers
for years before earning a degree in creative writing and starting to publish works of fiction.”
C. “Many of Tobar’s notable nonfiction articles are marked by the writer’s use of techniques usually associated with fiction,
such as complex narrative structures and the incorporation of symbolism.”

    'A museum curator is writing a biographical statement about Trinidadian-born Chinese dancer, choreographer, and teacher
Dai Ailian for a new exhibit on Chinese dance. The curator claims that some of the pieces Dai created shortly after arriving in

visited during her travels through China.

A. “There is no sound or music accompanying Dai’s movements in Yao Drum, aside from the sounds of drumsticks beating
against a drum and against each other.”

    'The fynbos shrubland is a diverse habitat found only in South Africa. It is adjacent to the Afro-temperate forest, with almost
no transition space between the two distinct habitats. Plants in the fynbos have uniquely thin and long root systems that
spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil. Ecologists transplanted tree seedlings from the forest into
plots in the fynbos. Seedlings in plots isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate fiv   e times greater than
that of the seedlings in plots in close proximity to the roots of fynbos plants.
Based on the text, what role do fynbos roots most likely have in maintaining the border between the fynbos shrubland and
the Afro-temperate forest habitats?
A. Fynbos roots damage the root systems of forest plants, leaving those plants unable to acquire sufficient nutrients.
B. Fynbos roots extend close enough to the forest plants’ roots that they constitute a physical barrier that forest plants’
roots cannot pass.
C. The root systems of fynbos plants allow the plants to take in so many soil nutrients that forest plants are prevented from
flourishing in the fynbos.

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents a conclusion about the role of fynbos roots in maintaining the border with
the Afro-temperate forest that can be reasonably inferred from the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos have
"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil." The text then
describes an experiment where forest tree seedlings grown in plots isolated from fynbos roots grew at a rate fiv   e times
greater than seedlings in areas near fynbos roots. This strongly suggests that fynbos roots are depleting soil nutrients to
such an extent that forest plants can’t get enough nutrients from that soil to flourish, thereby hindering the formation of any
significant "transition space" between the habitats and helping keep the border between them sharp.
Choice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that fynbos roots physically damage the root systems of forest
plants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as having "uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out
over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil." This description establishes that fynbos roots are specialized for
efficient nutrient absorption. The experiment then confirms this function of the roots by showing that forest seedlings
"isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate fiv   e times greater" than those near fynbos roots. This result
demonstrates that when forest seedlings don’t have to compete with the nutrient-absorbing fynbos roots, they grow much
better. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the fynbos and the Afro-temperate forest are distinct from,
and adjacent to, each other and that there is "almost no transition space" (area of mixed fynbos and forest plants), the
experiment shows that forest plants can grow in soil occupied by fynbos roots, just not very well. So, the idea that the fynbos
roots physically obstruct forest plants is unsupported by the text. Choice D is incorrect because it directly contradicts the
text’s claim that fynbos roots absorb nutrients from, and therefore deplete, the soil they’re in, and furthermore, nothing in the
text suggests that the habitat of the fynbos is harsh in general.',

    'Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the example of variations in
participants’ evaluations. The table shows participants’ evaluations of the likelihood that robots could work effectively in
different occupations. The text asserts that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on the occupation being

believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a tour guide but only 16% of participants
believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a surgeon illustrate this assertion: those data
show participants’ views changing substantially with the occupation being considered.
Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe data that illustrate the assertion that participants’ evaluations varied

data about participants’ responses when considering a single occupation—teaching—could not be an example of people’s

B. “[Mrs. Trent] nodded dismissal, and the three of them found themselves in the hall again. They looked at one another for
a moment of blank silence.”
C. “Patty’s eyes suddenly brightened. She seized [her friends] by [the] elbow and shoved them into the empty schoolroom.”

    'Choice D is the best answer because the quotation directly illustrates Patty trying hard to convince Mrs. Trent to allow the
group to continue sharing a room. The phrase "Patty did use all the diplomacy at her command" explicitly shows her making
a determined effort to be persuasive. The quotation further details Patty’s specific tactics: she "dwelt touchingly upon their
long friendship, and their sorrow at being separated." These details illustrate the claim by suggesting that Patty carefully
crafted and delivered an emotional appeal to Mrs. Trent about the effects of changing the group’s rooming situation.
Choice A is incorrect because although the quotation describes a reaction by Mrs. Trent, it does not reveal anything about
the events or conversation that might have prompted this reaction. Instead of depicting Patty’s efforts to be persuasive
during such a conversation, the quotation focuses on Mrs. Trent’s character traits; specifically, it describes the relationship
between her "sense of humour" and her "sense of justice." While the latter trait may be relevant to Patty’s situation, the
quotation doesn’t show the extent of her efforts to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the change in rooming arrangements.
Choice B is incorrect because this quotation describes the reaction of a group of three students immediately after an
encounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the outcome of an implied conversation but does not provide any evidence about the
topic or nature of the conversation itself, and therefore does not illustrate Patty’s efforts during a conversation to convince
Mrs. Trent to change her mind about the rooming situation. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation suggests
that Patty can be assertive (she abruptly grabbed her friends and "shoved them into the empty schoolroom"), it doesn’t show
Patty asserting herself by trying to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the proposed rooming arrangements. The quotation
doesn’t allude to Mrs. Trent or to Patty’s desire to continue sharing a room with a group of friends.',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Veronica Waweru’s thinking that is supported by the text.
The text begins by discussing Waweru’s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been
played at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone.
The text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued
to play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the
presence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played
at the site for a long time.
Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru "noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone," this
observation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not
specifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely
suggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used
for that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to
think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru
found the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn’t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had
been played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was
played, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any variation in
the depth of the pits. The text only describes the pits collectively as shallow and doesn’t indicate that the depth of the pits
factored into Waweru’s thinking about how long the site had been used for playing mancala.',

    'Water flowing around an obstruction creates vortices (patterns of swirls) of varying size; by detecting the vortices, fish can
determine the size and position of the obstruction. Testing by Yuzo R. Yanagisuru, Otar Akanyeti, and James C. Liao using
models of three head shapes—narrow (low ratio of width to length), intermediate, and wide (high ratio of width to length)—
showed that for medium-sized vortices, fish with wide heads would be least able to distinguish between vortices and general
turbulence in the water. A second research team has therefore hypothesized that in low-visibility conditions, wider-headed

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the second research
team’s hypothesis about how a fish’s head shape affects the fish’s ability to detect obstructions. The text explains that fish
detect obstructions using water vortices and that testing by Yanagisuru, Akanyeti, and Liao showed that fish with wide heads
struggle to distinguish medium-sized vortices from general turbulence in the water. Based on this finding, a second research
team hypothesized that in low-visibility conditions, wider-headed fish would be less effective at detecting obstructions than
narrower-headed fish. The finding that wider-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into obstructions more often than narrower-
headed dusky smooth-hound fish did under the specified conditions (low visibility with medium-sized vortices) would directly
support the second team’s hypothesis.
Choice A is incorrect because it would provide only partial support for the second research team’s hypothesis. While this
finding shows that wide-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into many obstructions, it provides no comparison with narrow-
headed fish. The hypothesis specifically predicts a difference in detection ability between fish with wider heads and those
with narrower heads, so supporting evidence would need to include data from both head types to allow for this comparison.
Choice B is incorrect because it would not support the second research team’s hypothesis comparing obstruction detection
between fish with wide heads and those with narrow heads. Instead, it examines variation within a single narrow-headed
species, which would not address the hypothesis about differences between fish with wider and narrower head shapes.
Choice D is incorrect because this finding would contradict rather than support the second research team’s hypothesis. The
hypothesis predicts that wider-headed fish will be less likely to detect obstructions than narrower-headed fish in low-visibility
conditions, which would result in wider-headed fish bumping into obstructions more frequently. A finding showing equal
bumping rates between fish with the two head shapes would indicate no relationship between head width and detection
ability, directly contradicting the hypothesis.',

To test the effects of a nitrogen fertilizer on cantaloupe production, researchers grew cantaloupe plants and harvested their
fruit over three years. In each year, half the plants were grown using a nitrogen fertilizer, and the other half were grown using
a control fertilizer that contained no nitrogen. The researchers concluded that the nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe
yield.

B. In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a greater yield than did plants treated with
the control fertilizer.
C. The 2018 yield for plants treated with the control fertilizer was greater than was the 2019 yield for plants treated with the

    'Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using
nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen
fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019). For each
year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value
in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group
yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25
while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using
nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.
Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre.
Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph—in 2018, the control-group yield is
greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre—a claim that the
control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers’ conclusion that nitrogen
fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the
nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is
due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.',

young fish since they help keep these fish fed and protected while they grow. To study the importance of mangroves to
young fish, researchers Mohamed A.Abu El-Regal and Nesreen K. Ibrahim collected and identified young fish from three
different mangrove sites in the Egyptian Red Sea. They collected fish in the winter, spring, and autumn of 2010, collecting a

    'Shimmering is a collective defense behavior that researchers have observed in giant honeybee colonies. When shimmering,
different groups of bees flip their bodies up and down in what looks like waves. This defense is initiated when hornets hover

specialized defense response to hornets, as it is not observed when other, larger predators approach the colony.

Xahuayxol0.90.3−0.91.4
Because water from natural, uncontaminated sources is less enriched with the stable nitrogen isotope N than wastewater
from human activities is, the presence of such wastewater in nature can be detected by examining delta 15-N values (a
measure of the ratio of N to N) in plants. Karla A. Camacho-Cruz and colleagues assessed delta 15-N values in the
seagrass Thalassia testudinum from sites on Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with intermediate tourism development, including
Akumal Bay and Tulum, and low tourism development, including Mahahual and Xahuayxol, throughout 2016 and 2017. The
data suggest that the intermediate-tourism sites experienced influxes of human wastewater. However, the researchers
concluded that this happened intermittently.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support the underlined conclusion?
A. Although delta 15-N values were generally higher in Akumal Bay and Tulum than in Mahahual and Xahuayxol, the values
were lower in Akumal Bay than in Mahahual and Xahuayxol in February 2017.
B. Delta 15-N values reached their lowest level in February 2017 in both Akumal Bay and Tulum, but no data were available
for Akumal Bay in February 2016, when the values reached their highest level in Tulum.
C. Although all sites showed considerable variation in delta 15-N values, the values remained relatively constant in Akumal
Bay from October 2016 to February 2017 and in Tulum from February 2016 to October 2016.
D. In Akumal Bay and Tulum, delta 15-N values fluctuated considerably across the three measurements made from October

    'Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the underlined conclusion. The text
accompanying the table states that delta 15-N values (a measure of the ratio of two nitrogen isotopes) can be used as an
indirect means of measuring the ratio of human wastewater to water from uncontaminated sources—the higher the delta 15-
N values, the greater the presence of human wastewater. The text goes on to mention an experiment conducted by
Camacho-Cruz and colleagues measuring delta 15-N values in seagrass on the Yucatan peninsula at several sites, four of
15
1514
which are presented in the table accompanying the text. Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Bay and Tulum, had
intermediate tourism development, and two others, Mahahual and Xahuayxol, had low tourism development. It is reasonable
to infer that sites with intermediate tourism have a greater human presence than those with low tourism and therefore are
subject to greater amounts of wastewater and exhibit higher delta 15-N values in seagrass. However, Camacho-Cruz and
colleagues found that the increase in delta 15-N values was not constant. The table supports this conclusion because the
two intermediate-tourism sites (Akumal Bay and Tulum) had delta 15-N values that fluctuated considerably—both had higher
delta 15-N values than the two low-tourism sites (Mahahual and Xahuayxol) in October 2016 and October 2017, but in
February 2017 the delta 15-N values for the intermediate-tourism sites dropped significantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low-
tourism site, had a higher delta 15-N value for that period). The fluctuations in values in Akumal Bay and Tulum support the
conclusion that these sites experienced influxes of human wastewater intermittently.
Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table: in February 2017 the delta 15-N value in Akumal
Bay was higher than the delta 15-N value in Xahuayxol, not lower. Choice B is incorrect because the absence of data for delta
15-N levels in Akumal Bay in February 2016 would neither prove nor disprove that the presence of human wastewater at
Akumal Bay and Tulum was not constant. Despite the unavailable data, there is still enough information to conclude that
delta 15-N levels at both sites fluctuated significantly and that influxes of human wastewater therefore happened
intermittently. Choice C is incorrect because a constancy in delta 15-N values would not indicate that the influx of human
wastewater was intermittent, but rather the opposite. Moreover, the two periods selected are not indicative of general trends
in the whole table (for example, the values fluctuated significantly in Akumal Bay between February 2017 and October 2017,
and in Tulum between October 2016 and February 2017).',

A. The oldest olive tree in the world is likely over 1,100 years old.

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents a detail that, if true, would most directly support the researcher’s claim
about the difficulty of determining olive tree age by ring counting. The text explains that for many trees, counting the dark
rings visible in a tree stump is a reliable method for determining the tree’s age. However, if olive trees have growth rings that
are difficult to see, it would be hard to count the individual rings. Therefore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or
impossible to use for olive trees. This directly supports the researcher’s claim that the ring-counting method often can’t be
used for olive trees because it identifies a specific characteristic of olive trees that could render this approach impracticable.
Choice A is incorrect because the probable age of the oldest olive tree doesn’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work for
determining olive tree age. The older age of some olive trees might make counting more tedious but doesn’t pose an
insurmountable obstacle to adopting the method. The researcher’s claim is about the feasibility of the ring-counting method
for olive trees, not about the potential impracticality of employing this method for particularly long-lived trees. Choice B is
incorrect because the fact that narrow growth rings might indicate harsh growing conditions has no direct bearing on the
claim that counting rings often can’t be used to determine olive tree age. It is possible that growth rings that are too narrowly
spaced might be difficult to count, but the researcher’s claim relates to the inapplicability of the ring-counting method to olive
trees in general rather than to olive trees that have experienced harsh conditions. Moreover, as long as they are visible, even
narrow growth rings might permit the ring-counting method to be used to determine tree age. Choice D is incorrect because
the ideal climate conditions for olive trees don’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work as a method for determining their
age. While growing conditions might affect ring formation patterns, the simple fact that olive trees thrive in hot, dry
environments doesn’t directly address why the conventional method of counting rings would be ineffective for determining
their age.',

    'The ice melted on a Norwegian mountain during a particularly warm summer in 2019, revealing a 1,700-year-old sandal to a
mountaineer looking for artifacts. The sandal would normally have degraded quickly, but it was instead well preserved for
centuries by the surrounding ice. According to archaeologist Espen Finstad and his team, the sandal, like those worn by
imperial Romans, wouldn’t have offered any protection from the cold in the mountains, so some kind of insulation, like fabric
or animal skin, would have needed to be worn on the feet with the sandal.
What does the text indicate about the discovery of the sandal?
A. Temperatures contributed to both protecting and revealing the sandal.

    'Alice Guy-Blaché directed hundreds of films between 1896 and 1920. She wanted audiences to feel like they were watching
real people on screen. She would encourage actors in her films to behave naturally. Guy-Blaché even hung a large sign
reading “Be Natural” in the studio where she made her films. At the time, films lacked sound, so actors needed to rely solely
on their bodies and facial expressions to convey emotions. As a result, actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and
expressions. The style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s films was therefore ______

produced from 1896 to 1920. This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s films was very unusual for the

Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s films,

incorrect. The text never discusses actors’ familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s films, so there isn’t much
basis for this inference. But since the text tells us that other films of the period used a highly exaggerated form of acting, we
might predict that the natural style in Guy-Blachés films would have been unfamiliar to these actors. Choice D is incorrect.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the
Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic
activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note,
however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current
conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been
transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reflect past volcanic

Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars’s surface such that its
current appearance isn’t a reliable guide to past activity, not that it’s likely that past eruptions were not as massive as
astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C
is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn’t imply that

volcanoes, there’s no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect
because nothing in the text suggests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than
volcanic eruptions. Although the text does suggest that the evidence consistent with volcanic eruptions shouldn’t be taken

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of
competing claims about the origins of red velvet cake. The text states that the origins of the recipe for red velvet cake "are
unclear." The text then presents four different entities that claim to have created the first red velvet cake recipe: a Dallas
bakery (1860s), the Adams Extract Co. (1930s), a US hotel (1930s), and a Canadian department store (1930s). Lastly, the
text states that "no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others." Given this information, it most
logically follows that it’s not possible to determine who baked the first red velvet cake, as there is insufficient evidence to
determine which claim, if any, is correct.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information indicating that red velvet cake existed before the 1860s.
According to the text, the earliest claim for creating red velvet cake comes from a bakery in Dallas, Texas, that asserted it
developed the first recipe for the cake at the time of the bakery’s opening in the 1860s. There’s no textual support for the
conclusion that the cake existed before this earliest claimed date, since the text presents only competing claims starting
from the 1860s and extending to the 1930s without evidence of earlier origins. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t
support the conclusion that none of the supposed inventors of red velvet cake likely invented the cake. The text states that
multiple entities claim to have invented the recipe and that "no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over
the others." This lack of decisive evidence doesn’t logically lead to the conclusion that all the claims are false; it merely
indicates that the cake’s true origins can’t be determined with the available evidence. The text leaves open the possibility that
one of the claimants could indeed be the actual inventor. Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no basis for
concluding that the Dallas bakery is "probably" the inventor of red velvet cake. While the text mentions that this bakery
claims to have created the recipe in the 1860s (making it the earliest claim), the text explicitly states that there’s no definitive
evidence supporting any of the claims about the cake’s origins over the others. The text presents all claims as equally
lacking in definitive supporting evidence.',

    '“Gestures” in painting are typically thought of as bold, expressive brushstrokes. In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten
built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his
series of “slab” paintings from that decade.  Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,”
signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift
represents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture,
both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______

    'Choice B is the best answer.    Whitten thinks the tool made “one gesture” paintings, while historians think the tool “removed
gesture” from the process completely. But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the historians would agree that the
paintings he made with the tool in the ’70s have way fewer gestures than his paintings from the ’60s, in which gestures are
“prevalent,” meaning widely and extensively present.
Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only discusses the “developer”—it never mentions other tools.
Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became more
interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestures,

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the museum
administrators’ claim that concerns about virtual tours replacing in-person visits were unjustified. The text explains that after
the Galleria dell’Accademia began offering online tours, there were concerns that if people viewed these virtual tours, they
would consider an in-person visit to be unnecessary. The finding that many visitors who were surveyed indicated that the
virtual tours actually convinced them to plan an in-person visit directly contradicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in-
person visits, virtual tours actively encouraged them, providing strong support for the administrators’ claim that the initial
concerns were unfounded.
Choice B is incorrect. The finding that most surveyed visitors were unaware of the virtual tours before their first in-person
visit wouldn’t directly address whether virtual tours affect decisions about in-person visits. This finding would only indicate
that these particular visitors didn’t have the opportunity to be influenced by virtual tours when making their decision to visit.
Choice C is incorrect because the geographic location of visitors wouldn’t address the impact of virtual tours on people’s
decisions to visit the museum in person. Whether visitors live in Florence or elsewhere would suggest nothing about whether
virtual tours influenced their choice. This information is irrelevant to the administrators’ claim about the relationship between
virtual tours and in-person visits. Choice D is incorrect because visitors’ intentions to view virtual tours after their in-person
visit wouldn’t address the initial concerns that virtual tours might make in-person visits seem unnecessary. This finding
indicates that some visitors plan to use virtual tours as a way to remember their visit, but it provides no information about
whether virtual tours influenced their decision to visit in person in the first place, which is what the administrators’ claim
addresses.',

composed in the 11th century, and Culhwch and Olwen from the second half of the 12th century. One of the most significant
sources, Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of Britain, was written in the 1130s; some material from it was later

that works containing such stories were available to him.
C. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s accounts of Arthurian legends in his History are more similar overall in content to the accounts

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion about the genealogy of Arthurian legends.
The text establishes a chronology of Arthurian sources, with Vita Sancti Cadoci composed in the 11th century (the 1000s),
Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History written in the 1130s, Wace’s Roman de Brut in 1155, and Culhwch and Olwen in the second
half of the 12th century (1150–1200). Importantly, the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffrey’s History, Wace added
"the famous Round Table" to it. If Wace introduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element
was not present in earlier works. This suggests that the Arthurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci, which was
written before both Geoffrey’s and Wace’s works, would not have featured the Round Table.
Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses several works that include legends about a character, King Arthur, but
doesn’t address the historical accuracy of the stories in those works or suggest that the creation of Culhwch and Olwen was
relevant to any other works’ accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that works containing stories of
the Round Table were available to Geoffrey of Monmouth when he composed his History in the 1130s, whether he was aware
of them or not; it instead suggests that the idea of the Round Table wasn’t introduced until more than a decade later, when
Wace added it to Geoffrey’s History. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the Arthurian legends in Geoffrey
of Monmouth’s History differ from those in Wace’s Roman de Brut in that Wace added the idea of the Round Table, the text
doesn’t compare the overall content of the Arthurian legends in the two works and doesn’t indicate anything about the overall
content of the legends in Culhwch and Olwen.',

    'As the name suggests, dramaturges originated in theater, where they continue to serve a variety of functions: conducting
historical research for directors, compiling character biographies for actors, and perhaps most importantly, helping writers of
plays and musicals to hone the works’ stories and characters. Performance scholar Susan Manning observes that many
choreographers, like playwrights and musical theater writers, are concerned with storytelling and characterization. In fact,
some choreographers describe the dances they create as expressions of narrative through movement; it is therefore
unsurprising that ______

A. dramaturges can have a profound impact on the artistic direction of plays and musicals.
B. choreographers developing dances with narrative elements frequently engage dramaturges to assist in refining those

    'Choice B is the best answer. Dramaturges help playwrights with storytelling and characterization. Choreographers often tell
stories through dance, so they are also concerned with storytelling and characterization. This suggests that the fact that
choreographers seek the help of dramaturges with the storytelling aspects of their dances should be “unsurprising.”
Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The beginning of the text does imply that this is true, but the end is
leading to a conclusion about how choreographers use dramaturges. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported.
The text never mentions dances by choreographers who don’t incorporate narrative elements. Choice D is incorrect. This
inference isn’t supported. The text mentions in passing that directors use dramaturges to conduct research, but it never
suggests that directors and actors are too reliant on them. Also, the text is leading to a conclusion about how

    'A member of the Otomi, an Indigenous people in Central Mexico, Octavio Medellín immigrated to the United States as a child,
and his sculpture bears the impress of traditions on both sides of the border: US-based modernist sculpture, Mexican
modernist painting, Otomi art, and the ancient sculpture of other Mexican Indigenous peoples, including the Maya. In his
1950 masterpiece History of Mexico, Medellín fuses these influences into a style so idiosyncratic that it resists efforts to
view his work through the lens of nationality or cultural identity. Artists, he insisted, should strive for individual expression,
even as they draw inspiration from their heritage and the communities where they live and work.
Which quotation from an art critic most directly challenges the underlined claim in the text?
A. “Although a number of ancient Indigenous artistic traditions pictured human forms in profile, the forms populating the
surface of A History of Mexico suggest a specifically Maya influence.”
B. “In A History of Mexico, the synthesis of ancient and modernist traditions functions as a stylistic parallel to the work’s
subject matter: a survey of centuries of Mexican history.”
C. “Many critics focus on Indigenous influences in A History of Mexico and other key works by Medellín to the exclusion of
influences from non-Indigenous art.”
D. “While A History of Mexico features modernist motifs, it relies primarily on angular human forms in profile—a staple of
Maya sculpture—and thus invites classification as Indigenous art.”',

    'Choice D is the best answer. This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic
(unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually “invites classification as Indigenous
art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity.
Choice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya influence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation
doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single
cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It
suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be defined by any
one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice
supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous
influences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the influences equally—that they should instead be viewing the work as an
idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses.',

    'Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able to vote.
We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both the main way people
qualified to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify
to vote likely had significant French real estate holdings.
Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax
burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and
windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows
increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we
don’t have enough information to determine if those with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights.
For example, it’s possible that those with significant foreign investments were likely to also be people with significant
domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don’t have the information necessary to make this inference.',

In Caddo, a language from what is now the US Southeast, vocabulary pertaining to corn cultivation resembles equivalent
vocabulary in the Totozoquean language family in Mexico. This resemblance is perhaps attributable to cultural contact: such
words could have entered Caddo through the intermediary of the neighboring but unrelated Chitimacha language, concurrent
with the dissemination of corn itself from Mexico into the Southeast after 700 CE. That the vocabulary pertaining to
domestic crops accompanies them as they diffuse into new regions is an established phenomenon globally. Crops may also
be decoupled from vocabulary altogether: corn cultivation became ubiquitous among the Southeastern tribes, yet ______
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A. the origins of vocabulary pertaining to the crop vary across languages in the region, with the words for corn in Cherokee

family (including Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscogee) and to one Iroquoian language (Cherokee).
C. corn-related vocabulary underwent changes when entering other, unrelated languages, as can be seen by the divergence

Economist Steve H. Hanke has shown that divided US Congresses—which occur when one party holds the majority in the
House of Representatives and another holds the majority in the Senate—tend to accompany reductions in total federal
outlays (spending) relative to gross domestic product (GDP), which Hanke interprets to reflect decreases in government size.
Hanke calculated the percentage point change in total outlays (encompassing nondefense and defense outlays) for
consecutive US Congresses. Hanke has pointed to his calculations as evidence that a divided Congress may be a “necessary
but not sufficient condition” for a decrease in government size to occur.

character’s fate. In the quotation, Hedda says that she wants “to have power to mould a human destiny,” or shape a person’s
fate, just as the text indicates. Additionally, the phrase “for once in my life” suggests that Hedda feels that she has never
been able to shape anyone’s life, including her own, supporting the text’s assertion that she “is unable to freely determine her
own future.”
Choice A is incorrect because this quotation shows Hedda being uncertain about what to do with her own life, not wanting to
influence another person’s fate. Choice C is incorrect because while this quotation shows Hedda’s interest in finding out
whether she has any power over another character, it doesn’t clearly show that she wants to influence that person’s fate. In
this quotation, Hedda seems to have inferred or concluded (“then”) that she doesn’t have any influence over the person to
whom she’s speaking, and she’s asking that person to confirm her lack of influence. Choice D is incorrect because this

    'In the 1970s, a roughly 60,000-year-old piece of hyena bone marked with nine notches was discovered at a site in western
France once inhabited by Neanderthals. Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating
numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information.
The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were
made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by
one individual as a means of counting something.
Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?
A. Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information.
B. More than nine approximately parallel notches made with a different stone tool are present on another artifact found at a

Neanderthals.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim:
assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the

To assess the impact of invasive species on ecosystems in Africa, Benis N. Egoh and colleagues reviewed government
reports from those nations about how invasive species are undermining ecosystem services (aspects of the ecosystem on
which residents depend). The services were sorted into three categories: provisioning (material resources from the
ecosystem), regulating (natural processes such as cleaning the air or water), and cultural (nonmaterial benefits of
ecosystems). Egoh and her team assert that countries in each region reported effects on provisioning services and that
provisioning services represent the majority of the reported services.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support Egoh and colleagues’ assertion?
A. Provisioning services represent 73% of the services reported for the West region and 33% of those for the Central region,
but they represent 75% of the services reported overall.
B. None of the percentages shown for provisioning services are lower than 33%, and the overall percentage shown for
provisioning services is 75%.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of patterns of linguistic distribution in New
York City. The text explains how Chinese immigrants in New York City tend to settle in different boroughs based on their
region of origin in China: those from north China (Mandarin speakers) typically settle in Queens, while those from south
China (Cantonese or Fuzhounese speakers) typically settle in Manhattan. This pattern demonstrates that the regional
language distribution in China (north versus south) has reproduced itself in New York City (Queens versus Manhattan).
Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that correlations between languages and regions in one country can replicate
themselves when citizens of that country emigrate to a new country.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss rates of language change. The text indicates that many languages are
spoken in New York City, but it doesn’t provide any information about how quickly these languages might be changing, either
in relation to each other or compared to areas where fewer languages are spoken. Choice B is incorrect because the text
provides no information about changes in vocabulary or pronunciation of immigrant languages compared to their original
forms. The text only discusses where different groups of language speakers tend to settle, not how their languages might
have evolved after immigration. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide any information about a relationship

docked ships in place, and a riding-light is a light that a ship shines when it is anchored.
When little lights in little ports come out,
Quivering down through water with the stars,
And all the fishing fleet of slender spars
Range at their moorings, veer with tide about;
When race of wind is stilled and sails are furled,
And underneath our single riding-light
The curve of black-ribbed deck gleams palely white,
And slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world;

Old age might sink upon a windy youth,
Quiet beneath the riding-light of truth,
Weathered through storms, and gracious in retreat.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text. The speaker describes an evening scene
observed from a boat: "little lights in little ports come out" and are reflected in the water’s surface "with the stars," fishing
boats are moored, "sails are furled" (rolled up), and the riding-light is shining. The speaker emphasizes the calmness of the
scene, noting that the "race of wind is stilled" and the atmosphere is sleepy ("slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world"),
and then indicates that the calmness prompts thoughts of how old age might be "sweet" and "quiet" and "gracious in retreat"
after "a windy youth" with "storms." Thus, the main idea is that the tranquility of a port in the evening can lead a person to
appreciate the potential stillness of old age.
Choice B is incorrect because the speaker isn’t discussing the difficulty of bringing a ship into port but describing the
calmness of the port at night. And rather than suggesting that old age involves struggles, the speaker suggests that after "a
windy youth" with "storms" to be weathered, old age will be "sweet," "quiet," and "gracious"—that is, old age will be tranquil like
a port at night. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker isn’t suggesting that a person who has lived a varied and active life
might find it difficult to stay in a calm place in old age. On the contrary, the speaker suggests that after a "windy youth" with
"storms," old age can be welcomed as something "sweet," "quiet," and "gracious," just like a calm port at night. Choice D is
incorrect. Although the speaker does touch on the idea of a "windy youth" followed by "sweet old age," the speaker doesn’t tie
that idea to a contrast between daytime activity and nighttime peacefulness at a port. The speaker doesn’t address any
activity during the day at a port, only briefly mentioning that the "race of wind is stilled" at the end of the day, and instead
focuses on the tranquility of the port at night and how it prompts thoughts of "quiet" and "gracious" old age.',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that fashion

sellers and researchers view the fashion industry. The text never addresses the way the fashion industry is viewed; rather, it
discusses a practical approach sellers in the industry can take to better match production with demand. Choice C is

predict demand, the text doesn’t focus on overstocking or characterize it as the main concern of sellers. Rather, the text is
focused on discussing the approach itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that fashion sellers encounter

store displays can influence consumers’ views of those products. Participants in several of the experiments regarded the
same products in the same (generic) retail settings as significantly more valuable when the product-to-space ratio was low
than when it was high. But in one of the experiments, Sevilla and Townsend arranged the same jewelry with different levels
of intervening space at an upscale retailer (Tiffany & Co.) and a relatively inexpensive retailer (Forever 21). The result of this

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the text’s conclusion about the results
of the experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21. According to the text, Sevilla and Townsend found in several
experiments that when products in a generic retail setting are displayed with a low product-to-space ratio (that is, with lots of
space between them), consumers view those products as significantly more valuable than when the same products are
displayed with a higher product-to-space ratio (less space between them). The text then states that the results of an
experiment specifically using the contexts of an inexpensive store (Forever 21) and an upscale one (Tiffany & Co.) suggest
that an inexpensive store context may moderate, or lessen, that effect. If Sevilla and Townsend found that participants in the
experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21 judged the same jewelry items as substantially more valuable when there was
lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.) but judged
the same jewelry items as only slightly more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little
space between them in the inexpensive store (Forever 21), that finding would demonstrate that increased space between
products was associated with less of an increase in those products’ perceived value at the inexpensive store than at the
upscale store. Thus, the finding would support the text’s conclusion that a store context associated with inexpensive goods
moderates the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their earlier experiments.
Choice B is incorrect because if Sevilla and Townsend found that at both upscale and inexpensive stores, participants judged
jewelry spaced far apart to be less valuable than jewelry spaced close together, that would show the opposite of the effect
the researchers observed in their earlier experiments, not show that an inexpensive store context merely moderates, or
lessens, that effect. Choice C is incorrect because this finding wouldn’t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed
in their initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced
close together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests
on determining the difference in jewelry items’ perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then
comparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a
finding that compares perceptions of the jewelry items’ value between the two stores but for only one type of spacing
condition at a time wouldn’t provide information about the degree of difference between spacing conditions within each type
of store context. Choice D is incorrect because this finding wouldn’t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in
their initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced
close together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests
on determining the difference in jewelry items’ perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then
comparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of consumer expectations and the
struggles delivery companies face. The text states that while consumers expect ever-faster delivery of goods, delivery
companies "continue to struggle with last-mile logistics." The text further explains that innovations aimed at addressing this
challenge have a tendency to cause complications of their own. Because escalating consumer demands for speed are
paired with persistent, complex delivery obstacles and new problems arising from attempted solutions, it logically follows
that consumer expectations for delivery times may be exceeding what companies can feasibly provide.
Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea of delivery volumes at all and makes it clear that companies
are already aware of and trying to address consumers’ expectations for delivery. Further, the challenge presented at the end
of the text relates to new problems that tend to arise with solutions for logistical problems, not to a lack of understanding of
what consumers want or how delivery volumes fluctuate. Choice C is incorrect. The text does suggest that rapid delivery is
important for customer satisfaction and thus is a beneficial investment for companies, but that idea is already presented in
the beginning of the text and doesn’t logically follow as a conclusion from the information about innovations companies are
exploring to solve last-mile logistics problems; the idea that the potential solutions tend to introduce new issues points to
the feasibility of meeting consumer expectations, not to the general fact that it would be beneficial to reduce delivery times.
Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there may be insufficient incentive for delivery companies to try
to solve last-mile logistics problems—on the contrary, the text directly indicates that delivery companies are already actively
pursuing innovations to try to address those problems, citing the example of the use of aerial drones, even though the

    '“Ghosts of the Old Year” is an early 1900s poem by James Weldon Johnson. In the poem, the speaker describes
experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection: ______
Which quotation from “Ghosts of the Old Year” most effectively illustrates the claim?
A. “What does this brazen tongue declare, / That falling on the midnight air / Brings to my heart a sense of care / Akin to
fright?”
B. “The snow has ceased its fluttering flight, / The wind sunk to a whisper light, / An ominous stillness fills the night, / A
pause—a hush.”
C. “It tells of many a squandered day, / Of slighted gems and treasured clay, / Of precious stores not laid away, / Of fields
unreaped.”
D. “And so the years go swiftly by, / Each, coming, brings ambitions high, / And each, departing, leaves a sigh / Linked to the

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of
the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. In this quotation, the
speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other
words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each,
departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole
quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the
ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing”
indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by
regretful reflection.
Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful
reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has
occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figur  ative way of saying that the speaker has
heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of
anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that
the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a
particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this
quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of
anticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities.',

    'Mosses can struggle in harsh desert conditions because these plants require enough sunlight for photosynthesis but not so
much that they risk drying out. Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia
caninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these
semitransparent rocks benefited the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S.
caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the
shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that

A. S. caninervis is one of the few types of moss that can survive under semitransparent rocks.
B. quartz crystals do not transmit the necessary sunlight for photosynthesis in S. caninervis.

    'Choice C is the best answer because  it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species
need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out.
Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were
semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was
longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as
the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in
greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity
and are thus able to retain more moisture.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other
such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text
explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than
specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the
moss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath
semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a
comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative
thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss.',

    'Black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are a nutritionally dense food, but they are difficult to digest in part because of their high
levels of soluble fiber and compounds like raffinose. They also contain antinutrients like tannins and trypsin inhibitors, which
interfere with the body’s ability to extract nutrients from foods. In a research article, Marisela Granito and Glenda Álvarez
from Simón Bolívar University in Venezuela claim that inducing fermentation of black beans using lactic acid bacteria
improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious.
Which finding from Granito and Álvarez’s research, if true, would most directly support their claim?
A. When cooked, fermented beans contained significantly more trypsin inhibitors and tannins but significantly less soluble
fiber and raffinose than nonfermented beans.
B. Fermented beans contained significantly less soluble fiber and raffinose than nonfermented beans, and when cooked, the
fermented beans also displayed a significant reduction in trypsin inhibitors and tannins.
C. When the fermented beans were analyzed, they were found to contain two microorganisms, Lactobacillus
casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, that are theorized to increase the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the gut after eating
beans.

cooked at high pressure.',

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that would best support Granito and Álvarez’s claim that
fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble fiber
and raffinose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the
body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of
soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation
improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious.
Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body’s ability to extract
nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would
likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and Álvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect
because the text doesn’t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food’s digestibility or
level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn’t
provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is
incorrect because Granito and Álvarez’s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that
nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that
the role of the cooking method could be significant when it comes to nutrition; further, the finding wouldn’t address the
beans’ digestibility.',

Research on this phenomenon has tended to focus on philanthropic gifting by London’s largest guilds; for her part, Kilburn-

    'Choice C is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of the role of gift giving among members of
guilds in early modern London. According to the text, members of these guilds participated in a culture where giving gifts
"both signaled and conferred social status"—that is, it indicated people’s social standing and also gave them social standing
—and occurred in the forms of both philanthropic gifting (donations for humanitarian purposes) by large guilds, which much
research has focused on, and the gifting of handmade items between craft guild members, which Kilburn-Toppin focuses on.
The text indicates that Kilburn-Toppin characterizes craft guild members as people who made and consumed items and
were "highly discerning," or were careful judges of quality. Because gift giving benefited one’s status and if craft guild
members were particularly attentive to quality, it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds—between people who
had high standards for items they made and for items they received—may have been a way for members to maintain and
enhance their professional reputations, or their professional statuses, among their peers.
Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes the idea that members of guilds participated in gift giving both to display
and receive social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the "highly discerning" members of craft
guilds had to do with the members’ interest in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the practice of gifting
those items within the craft guilds was intended to limit knowledge of materials and techniques to the members of those
guilds. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between "ostentatious," or very showy, and "prosaic," or
ordinary, gifts and because the characterization at the end of the text pertains specifically to the gifting of handmade items
indicative of great taste, not prosaic items, between members of craft guilds. And while the text indicates that London’s
largest guilds gave philanthropic gifts (donations for humanitarian purposes), it doesn’t indicate whether these gifts would
have been considered ostentatious. Choice D is incorrect because the characterization presented at the end of the text
pertains specifically to the "highly discerning" members of craft guilds giving their handmade items as gifts to one another
within the craft guilds; the text doesn’t suggest anything about gifting those items to members of London’s largest guilds or
how that might affect status differently from giving them to other craft guild members.',

Researchers recently conducted an experiment to understand how we use rankings to make decisions. They created a
fictitious travel website describing five museums in London. Then, they invited two groups of participants, who had never
visited the museums, to review the site and select the museum they would be most likely to visit. Meanwhile, the researchers
tracked the amount of time each participant spent reading about each museum. For one group, the website ranked each
museum, titling the page “The Top 5 Museums in London.” For the other group, the museums and their descriptions were not
ranked. The researchers concluded that when reviewing ranked lists, we tend to focus on the top-ranked option.
Which choice best describes data in the table that support the researchers’ conclusion?
A. Participants who were not provided with a ranking of the museums spent roughly equal amounts of time reading about
each museum.
B. Participants who were provided with a ranking of the museums spent disproportionately more time reading about the
British museum.
C. Participants who were provided with a ranking of the museums spent the least amount of time reading about the Natural
History Museum.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Stöger and her team’s claim that
giraffes use humming to communicate when they cannot signal to one another visually. The text indicates that scientists
have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another.
The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low-
pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the

Choice A is incorrect because finding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on
Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot

low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings.
Choice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support
Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different

annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork
on the roof and coping was like an architect’s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in

important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the
important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace
human archaeologists.
Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more
quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be
replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work
not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer
model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn’t support the
researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some
archaeologists are worried because the computer model’s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether
both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results
showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the
researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special
training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer
models’ success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.',

    'To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting
to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps’ burrows. Resin casting involves completely filling an empty burrow with a
liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying
the burrow. In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner
can accurately record a burrow’s measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building
process, something that’s impossible with resin casting because ______

multiple castings of the same burrow over time.
Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss size requirements for completing resin casting, so there’s no basis for
this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions how long the casting process takes nor how long A.
bellulus takes to construct a borrow, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage never states

    'Choice D is correct. The system of equations can be solved using the substitution method. Solving the second equation for y
gives y = –x – 1. Substituting the expression –x – 1 for y into the first equation gives –x – 1 = x + 2x + 1. Adding x + 1 to
both sides of the equation yields x + 3x + 2 = 0. The left-hand side of the equation can be factored by finding two numbers
whose sum is 3 and whose product is 2, which gives (x + 2)(x + 1) = 0. Setting each factor equal to 0 yields x + 2 = 0 and x +
1 = 0, and solving for x yields x = –2 or x = –1. These values of x can be substituted for x in the equation y = –x – 1 to find the
corresponding y-values: y = –(–2) – 1 = 2 – 1 = 1 and y = –(–1) – 1 = 1 – 1 = 0. It follows that (–2, 1) and (–1, 0) are the
solutions to the given system of equations. Therefore, (x, y) = (–2, 1), (x, y) = (–1, 0), and y + y = 1 + 0 = 1.
Choice A is incorrect. The solutions to the system of equations are (x, y) = (–2, 1) and (x, y) = (–1, 0). Therefore, –3 is the

less than 1, the number of brachiopod species decreases as the ocean depth increases. Specifically, the number of
brachiopod species at a depth of  meters is 90% of the number of brachiopod species at a depth of d meters. This

theater sold a total of 30 tickets, a + c = 30. The price per adult ticket is $12, and the price per child ticket is $8. Since the
theater received a total of $300 for the 30 tickets sold, it follows that 12a + 8c = 300. To eliminate c, the first equation can be
multiplied by 8 and then subtracted from the second equation:
Because the question asks for the amount spent on adult tickets, which is 12a dollars, the resulting equation can be
multiplied by 3 to give 3(4a) = 3(60) = 180. Therefore, $180 was spent on adult tickets.
Alternate approach: If all the 30 tickets sold were child tickets, their total price would be 30($8) = $240. Since the actual total
price of the 30 tickets was $300, the extra $60 indicates that a certain number of adult tickets, a, were sold. Since the price
of each adult ticket is $4 more than each child ticket, 4a = 60, and it follows that 12a = 180.',

week, so this week he will save  dollars. The inequality  represents the condition that he
will save at least $270 for the week. Factoring 10 out of the expression  gives . The product of 10 and 0.9
is 9, so the inequality can be rewritten as . Dividing both sides of this inequality by 9 yields , so
. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $270 for the week is 22.
Choices A and B are incorrect because Ken can save $270 by working fewer hours than 38 or 33 for the rest of the week.
Choice D is incorrect. If Ken worked 16 hours for the rest of the week, his total earnings for the week will be
, which is less than $270. Since he saves only 90% of his earnings each week, he would save even
less than $240 for the week.',

Alternatively, if an equation represents the relationship between x and y, then when each pair of x and y from the table is
substituted into the equation, the result will be a true statement. Of the equations given, the equation y = 2x + 3 in choice A is
the only equation that results in a true statement when each of the pairs of x and y are substituted into the equation.
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because when at least one pair of x and y from the table is substituted into the equations
given in these choices, the result is a false statement. For example, when the pair x = 4 and y = 11 is substituted into the
equation in choice B, the result is 11 = 3(4) – 2, or 11 = 10, which is false.',

Alternate approach: After determining the mode, 18, and the median, 19, it remains to determine whether the mean is less
than 19 or more than 19. Because the mean is a balancing point, there is as much deviation below the mean as above the
mean. It is possible to compare the data to 19 to determine the balance of deviation above and below the mean. There is a

by subtracting 2.5 from 3.3, which yields 0.8. It’s given that the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers. Thus, the
increase in population is , or 80,200.
Alternate approach: It’s given that the population density of Iceland, in people per square kilometer of land area, in 1990 was
2.5. Since the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers, it follows that the population of Iceland in 1990 was
