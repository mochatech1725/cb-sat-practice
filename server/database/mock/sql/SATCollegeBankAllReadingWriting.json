    "question_text": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly\ndouble the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the\ndescription of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms\nis poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to\nevaluate microorganisms as species.

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the\ndifferent counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the\nnumber of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can\nonly be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means\nthere must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The\ntext goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological\nvariability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect\non the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar\nnumbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from\ndifferences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated\nsome of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas\nBianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many\nmore species than Bianchi and Morri did.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate\nspecies in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the\nstudies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s\ncount that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of\nBianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been\nless sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues\nwere. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and\nMorri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation\nwould lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as\nvariations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll\nand colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and\nMorri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report\nfewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and\ncolleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should\nhave been even larger.",

    "question_text": "The ancient Greek concept of “mimesis,” a term used in the works of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers in\ndiscussions of representational art—visual, performance, or literary art that aims to depict the real world—is a foundational\nconcept of the Western philosophy of aesthetics. Mimesis is typically translated as “imitation” in modern editions of ancient\nGreek texts, but scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: “imitation” implies that art merely copies—and\nis thus by definition entirely derivative of—a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating “mimesis”\nthusly obscures the multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality.\nWhich statement, if true, would most directly support the claim by Halliwell presented in the text?\nA. One of the earliest appearances of mimesis’s root word, mimos, can be found in an ancient Greek tragedy in reference to\ndramatic impersonation, and the mim- root came to be generally associated with the musical and poetic arts by the fifth\ncentury BCE.\nB. Both Plato’s and Aristotle’s theorizations of mimesis examine the psychological effects that works of art induce in the\nviewer or listener.\nC. Although several of Plato’s earliest philosophical works discuss aesthetic ideas, the term “mimesis” doesn’t appear in\nPlato’s discussions of art until Cratylus, a relatively late work.\nD.

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement that would support Halliwell’s claim that \"imitation\" is an overly\nsimplified translation of the word \"mimesis\" in the context of ancient Greek philosophical discussions of representational art\nand that, because it suggests a view of art as merely copying things that exist in reality, the translation obscures the fact that\nPlato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality in varied ways. If Plato’s works\ntend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of\nmere imitation), while Aristotle’s works suggest that the term \"mimesis\" can refer to art’s ability to show conditions that don’t\ncurrently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the\nterm \"mimesis\" means more than just \"imitation\" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship\nbetween art and reality.\nChoice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos first being used in drama and the root mim- coming to\nbe associated with music and poetry wouldn’t indicate anything about the meaning of the specific term \"mimesis\" as it was\nused by ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on\nHalliwell’s claim that a common translation of the specific term is an oversimplification. Choice B is incorrect because the\nissue of art’s psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is\nrelated to reality, so the idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn’t\nhave any bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of that term oversimplifies the relationship between art and\nreality. Further, this idea would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the\nmultifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art’s relation to reality. Choice C is\nincorrect because the idea that Plato discussed aesthetics in his early works but didn’t use the term \"mimesis\" until later\ndoesn’t give any indication of how Plato or any other ancient Greek philosophers understood the relation between art and\nreality, so it would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the term \"mimesis\" is oversimplified and\nfails to reflect the varied ways the philosophers understood that relationship.",

    "question_text": "Biologists have predicted that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature, but this hadn’t been tested in mountain\nenvironments.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of perceptions of digital versus\nphysical gift cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of \"the time spent obtaining a gift...as a reflection of the\ngift’s thoughtfulness\" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards\nview them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found\nphysical gift cards more \"socially acceptable\" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards\n\"can be purchased online from anywhere\" with the fact that physical gift cards \"sometimes must be purchased in person\"—\nsuggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text’s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the\nthoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift\ncards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually\nprefer gift cards in the more usable digital format.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients’ preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the\nrelative ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn’t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of\nthese factors. Moreover, the text establishes that recipients regard digital gift cards as easier to use and therefore preferable\nto physical gift cards. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of\nownership toward them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the\ntext contrasts the two formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the difficulty involved in acquiring them\nand discusses how those factors influence people’s perceptions of the two formats.

According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in\nthe early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts\nmight be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the\nHaudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn’t learn these\ntechniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn’t invent the techniques independently, then the\nmost logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by\nHaudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural\npractices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming.\nChoice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using\nHaudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the\ncrops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers’ crops\nwere ill suited to the techniques, it’s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect\nbecause the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the\nnortheastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region. Choice D is incorrect because\nthe text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth\ncentury.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion\nabout banana ripening time with and without ethylene at different temperatures. The graph shows that at 20°C, the gap\nbetween the two bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2\ngridlines (from about 4 days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph\nshows that at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated\nbananas to about 11 days for untreated bananas at 14°C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for\nuntreated bananas at 16°C; and from about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18°C).\nSince the gap between the bars at each of these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps\nis larger than the gap between the bars at 20°C, it can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute\nchange in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at 20°C.\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than\nethylene-treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20°C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18°C,\n16°C, and 14°C, respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at\nthe other temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20°C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively). The\ninformation in the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20°C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas\nat the other temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the\ngraph shows that as temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14°C\nto about 5.5 days at 20°C, with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were\nassociated with absolute differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature\nand differences in ripening time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated\nbananas at 14°C and 16°C were about 8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of\nethylene-treated bananas at 18°C and 20°C, which were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated\nwith ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14°C and 16°C than at 18°C and 20°C.",

Of the 618 respondents from Quito, 82.9% indicated that they use the city’s parks, and of the 663\nrespondents from Lima, 72.7% indicated using city parks. Given that the percentage of Quito respondents who reported\nliving within a 10-minute walk of a park was much lower than that reported by Lima respondents, greater proximity alone\ncan’t explain the difference in park use.\nThe text makes which point about the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using\nparks?\nA. It was much larger than the researchers conducting the study expected.\nB. It is caused by something other than the parks’ proximity to city residents.\nC. It could be due to inaccuracies in the survey results.\nD. It was calculated using sources that predate the survey.",

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about the difference between the proportions of Quito\nresidents and Lima residents using parks that is supported by the text. The text states that 82.9% of surveyed Quito\nresidents and 72.7% of surveyed Lima residents reported using their city’s parks. The text then notes that compared to Lima\nrespondents, a much smaller percentage of Quito respondents said they live within a 10-minute walk of a park. The text\nconcludes that because a greater proportion of Quito respondents used parks despite generally living farther from them than\nLima respondents did, \"greater proximity\"—being closer to a park—\"can’t explain the difference in park use.\" That is, the text\nmakes the point that the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks is caused by\nsomething other than the distance of the parks from city residents.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether the researchers had expected a particular result and doesn’t\nindicate that they were surprised by the difference in park usage between the two cities’ residents. The text simply presents\nthe survey findings without stating the researchers’ expectations. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication\nthat there might be inaccuracies in the survey results; the text presents the findings as factual information and uses them as\nthe basis for a conclusion that a certain factor doesn’t explain differences in park usage between Quito and Lima residents.\nChoice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any sources that predate the survey or suggest that the difference in\nproportions was calculated using such sources. According to the text, the information about park usage came directly from\nthe survey of residents in Quito and Lima.",

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of conservation approaches for the\nMammillaria cactus M. boolii. The text establishes that M. boolii only grows naturally in the state of Sonora in Mexico, which\nmakes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The text then contrasts two approaches to conservation: the traditional single-\nspecies approach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based approach that considers the\ninteractions between climate, terrain, and various species in a geographical area. According to the text, conservationists\nhave recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this\necosystem view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving M. boolii would likely fail to consider how the\ncactus’s survival depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora’s ecosystem.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii throughout\nMexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses specifically on M. boolii in Sonora and different\napproaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora\nwould reduce competition for M. boolii or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this specific dynamic. In\nfact, the text implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn’t\nspecify how climatic changes might affect competition between species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t\nsuggest that the single-species approach would shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. boolii itself—rather, it\nsuggests that this approach might be too narrowly focused on M. boolii alone without considering the broader ecosystem-\nrelated factors that affect its survival.",

    "question_text": "In 1534 CE, King Henry VIII of England split with the Catholic Church and declared himself head of the Church of England, in\npart because Pope Clement VII refused to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Two years later, Henry VIII introduced a\npolicy titled the Dissolution of the Monasteries that by 1540 had resulted in the closure of all Catholic monasteries in\nEngland and the confiscation of their estates. Some historians assert that the enactment of the policy was primarily\nmotivated by perceived financial opportunities.\nWhich quotation from a scholarly article best supports the assertion of the historians mentioned in the text?\nA. “At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about 2 percent of the adult male population of England were monks;\nby 1690, the proportion of the adult male population who were monks was less than 1 percent.”\nB. “A contemporary description of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Michael Sherbrook’s Falle of the Religious Howses,\nrecounts witness testimony that monks were allowed to keep the contents of their cells and that the monastery timber\nwas purchased by local yeomen.”\nC. “In 1535, the year before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry commissioned a survey of the value of\nchurch holdings in England—the work, performed by sheriffs, bishops, and magistrates, began that January and was\nswiftly completed by the summer.”\nD. “The October 1536 revolt known as the Pilgrimage of Grace had several economic motives: high food prices due to a\npoor harvest the prior year; the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which closed reliable sources of food and shelter for\nmany; and rents and taxes throughout Northern England that were not merely high but predatory.”",

If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate\nwith REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We’d also expect the seals to maintain those\nelevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM\nsleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically.\nChoice A is incorrect.

    "question_text": "Roasted green chiles are a popular ingredient in Southwestern cuisine, but the traditional roasting method of burning\npropane is not environmentally friendly. To see if solar power could provide a better alternative, engineer Kenneth Armijo and\nhis team roasted batches of green chiles using between 38 and 42 heliostats, which are devices that concentrate sunlight.\nThe team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found\nthat propane yielded faster results.

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view Siemomysł and Mieszko II Lambert\nthat is supported by the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of different members. The text refers to\ntwo of the rulers in the Piast dynasty by name: Mieszko II Lambert, whose rule was known to have occurred from 1025 to\n1031 CE, and Siemomysł (\"whose historical actuality is disputed\"), for whom less is known and who therefore is the subject\nof debate among historians. The text further casts doubt about Siemomysł by stating that he is \"said to have ruled\" during\nthe 10th century, or the 900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn’t rule. The text also mentions that the chronicle’s\ndocumentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lambert. This\nindicates that historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert was an actual historical figure, but they disagree about whether\nSiemomysł existed.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text states that the Gesta principum Polonorum’s documentation of Siemomysł comes\nfrom oral tradition—spoken rather than written documentation—unlike its records of rulers who came after Siemomysł. This\nsuggests that the chronicle provides less reliable evidence rather than more evidence for Siemomysł’s existence in the 900s\n(or the 10th century) than it does for later rulers like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. Choice C is\nincorrect because the text indicates the opposite: Siemomysł supposedly ruled earlier in the 10th century, while Mieszko II\nLambert ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. The 10th century spans the years from 901 to 1000 CE, so Siemomysł is believed to\nhave ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lambert did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text\nmentions that information in the written chronicle Gesta principum Polonorum draws its information about Siemomysł from\nthe oral tradition, it doesn’t mention orally transmitted stories about Mieszko II Lambert. Instead, it states that the chronicle’s\ndocumentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition unlike the records of later rulers do, which suggests that the\ndocumentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lambert did not rely on oral tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made\nabout how convincing the orally transmitted stories of each ruler are to historians.",

With each generation, small differences are\nintroduced that result in distinct variations—called dialects—among geographically isolated populations of the same\nspecies. A research study examined whether twelve-day-old Ficedula hypoleuca (pied flycatcher) nestlings prefer local\ndialects over the unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal F. hypoleuca populations: the more begging calls the nestlings made in\nresponse to a song, the stronger their preference.

    "question_text": "In the 1980s, many musicians and journalists in the English-speaking world began to draw attention to music from around\nthe globe—such as mbaqanga from South Africa and quan họ from Vietnam—that can’t be easily categorized according to\nBritish or North American popular music genres, typically referring to such music as “world music.” While some scholars\nhave welcomed this development for bringing diverse musical forms to prominence in countries where they’d previously\nbeen overlooked, musicologist Su Zheng claims that the concept of world music homogenizes highly distinct traditions by\nreducing them all to a single category.\nWhich finding about mbaqanga and quan họ, if true, would most directly support Zheng’s claim?\nA.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. Zheng’s claim is that the idea of world music “homogenizes” (meaning makes similar) distinct\nkinds of music by reducing them to one category. In other words, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful\noversimplification of diverse musical forms. To support this claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so\ndifferent from one another that they should not fall into the same category. If it’s true that mbaqanga and quan họ developed\nseparately and have little in common musically, then it wouldn’t make sense to lump them into the same category.\nChoice B is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical\ntraditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. A difference in popularity\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that the two musical traditions shouldn’t be categorized together: instead, we need to know if the\nmusic itself is similar or different.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the inference that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the\ngenetic material of alpacas. The text states that modern alpacas get only 64 percent of their genetic material from their wild\nancestor (the vicuña), while llamas get 95.5 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the guanaco). These\ndata imply that relative to llamas, alpacas have experienced a much greater genetic shift away from their wild ancestors (36\npercent of their genetic material derives from another source, compared to 4.5 percent of llamas’ genetic material).\nMoreover, the text establishes that the remainder of alpacas’ genetic material derives from llamas, and the remainder of\nllamas’ genetic material derives from alpacas, reflecting a period of interbreeding. Taken together, these details support the\ninference that the period of interbreeding had a more significant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of\nllamas, thereby reducing the percentage of alpacas’ genetic material that derives from wild ancestors and placing alpacas at\na greater remove from these ancestors.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about genetic diversity within modern llama and alpaca\npopulations. While the text discusses the percentage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited from its wild\nancestor and from interbreeding, it does not address the level of genetic variation within each species. Therefore, it isn’t\nlogical to infer that modern llama populations have a greater degree of genetic diversity than modern alpaca populations do.\nChoice B is incorrect because it contradicts the chronology presented in the text. The text states that alpacas were\ndomesticated about 7,000 years ago, but the interbreeding with llamas occurred \"between 400 and 600 years ago.\" The\ngenetic mixing happened thousands of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not provide details\nabout what the process of domestication might entail. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that llama genetic material was\nintroduced during the domestication process of alpacas. Choice D is incorrect because though the text notes that guanacos\nand vicuñas contributed to the genetic material of alpacas and llamas, it only discusses alpacas’ and llamas’ genetic\ncomposition. Therefore, the text does not support the inference that modern populations of guanacos and vicuñas would\nlikely show traces of ancient interbreeding.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by acknowledging\nthat in 2022, Dimopoulos et al. were justified in arguing for antigravity on theoretical grounds because although there was no\nexperimental evidence supporting its existence at that time, there was no evidence contradicting its existence either. The\ntext then introduces the 2023 report describing an experiment that produced observations \"thoroughly inconsistent with\nantigravity.\" Thus, the main idea is that while the study of antigravity was theoretically justified before the 2023 report (due to\nlack of evidence against it), the report’s findings undermine the rationale for such theoretical consideration since there is\nnow evidence against this hypothetical phenomenon.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although antihydrogen ballistics observations were conducted at CERN, the text provides no evidence\nthat they were conducted to test conclusions in Dimopoulos et al.’s 2022 paper.

The text states\nthat although it has been hypothesized that birds’ bill size should increase with habitat temperature (an adaptation that\nreflects the fact that birds can release excess heat through their bills), Probst and colleagues concluded after studying mean\nbill surface area in North American thrashers that this hypothesis was not fully supported. In other words, Probst and\ncolleagues did not observe the predicted positive relationship between mean bill surface area and habitat temperature in the\nthrashers they studied. The data in the table about the ocellated thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion\nbecause this species has the greatest mean bill surface area (3.26 cm), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum\ntemperature in the warmest month (27.56°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, species such as the ocellated thrasher\nthat have colder habitats would likely also have smaller bills.

If the hypothesis were fully supported, the\nBendire’s thrasher and other species with warmer habitats would also have larger bills. Because data in the table show that\nthe ocellated thrasher and the Bendire’s thrasher have the opposite or near opposite of the hypothesized relationship\nbetween bill size and habitat temperature, these examples support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion that this hypothesis\nisn’t fully supported.\nChoice A is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Bendire’s thrasher has the second-smallest\nmean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean\nminimum temperature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (rather than the lowest) mean maximum\ntemperature in the warmest month. Moreover, the data about this species’ bill surface area and mean minimum temperature\nsuggest that smaller bills are associated with colder habitats, supporting rather than challenging the hypothesis that bill size\nincreases with habitat temperature.

The contrast emphasized in the\ntext most directly suggests that the fitness study may cost less than a study like HILDA because the fitness study aims only\nto determine a current percentage and thus can be completed well without extending data collection over years.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly introduces the idea of a less expensive, straightforward fitness study as a\ncontrast to many longitudinal studies that, like HILDA, have high costs because they require data collection over many years.\nThe fitness study is described as trying merely to gather information about a current behavior (how many regular exercisers\ndo weight training) rather than track trends over time, which suggests that costs could remain low because expensive\nlongitudinal methods would not be needed, not because they would be suitable.

In the quotation, the speaker makes it clear that she plans to walk somewhere\nbased on her own wishes (“where my own nature would be leading”) rather than follow anything else (“another guide”), and\nthat she’ll walk “in ferny glens” alongside the mountain.\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that the speaker wants to avoid pursuing money and education (“busy\nchase of wealth and learning”) and instead return to some earlier interests (her “first feelings”); the quotation doesn’t\naddress her determination to experience the countryside. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker is describing the\ncircumstances under which she won’t walk, which doesn’t address her determination to experience the countryside. Choice\nD is incorrect because rather than conveying her determination to experience the countryside, the speaker is explaining a\nparticular thing she won’t do (“seek not the shadowy region”).",

In their 2016 study of a school in an Anishinaabe community in\nOntario, Canada, scholars Lindsay Morcom and Stephanie Roy (who are Anishinaabe themselves) found that the model not\nonly imparted fluency in the Anishinaabe language but also enhanced students’ pride in Anishinaabe culture overall.

The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of\neducation on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model—which is used with students during pre-K or\nelementary school—increased students’ fluency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The\nresearchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be\nmore likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride\nafter finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they\nknow with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the\nresearchers predict.\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel approximately the same\ndegree of cultural pride as those adults who did attend wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will\nbe more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations.

Since it’s unlikely lemons were eaten more often than dairy, this fact casts\ndoubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets.\nChoice A is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a \"major component of the\nDutch diet,\" while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than\ndairy products.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to exemplify the researcher’s claim—\nnamely, that the duration of ice on some lakes has declined between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s. According to the\ngraph, Oulujärvi had surface ice for nearly 200 days in the winter of 1980–81 but only about 160 days of ice in the more\nrecent winter of 2005–06, evidence of a clear decline in the duration of surface ice between these time periods.\nChoice A is incorrect because it focuses on only one period of time (the early 1980s). Thus, the data it cites don’t support the\nresearcher’s claim, which compares the duration of surface ice across two specific periods of time (the early 1980s and the\nmid-2000s). Choice B is incorrect because although it accurately describes data from the graph, it contradicts the\nresearcher’s claim about declining surface ice duration. It describes an increase, not a decline, in the duration of surface ice\non Lake Neusiedl between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s (from about 80 days in 1980–81 to about 100 days in 2005–\n06). Therefore, the example of Lake Neusiedl wouldn’t logically support the claim that some lakes have seen a decline in the\nduration of surface ice. Choice D is incorrect because it provides information that doesn’t support the researcher’s claim\nabout declining ice duration. The graph could indicate that both Lake Neusiedl and Oulujärvi had more than 105 days of ice\nin the winter of 2005–06, but on its own, this information doesn’t demonstrate a decline in ice duration between the early\n1980s and the mid-2000s.",

The text indicates that Moses and colleagues analyzed infrared imaging and spectroscopy\ndata about Neptune obtained in different years by various instruments. The table lists the observatories where these\ninstruments are housed, the type of data each instrument collected (infrared imaging or spectroscopy), and the years in\nwhich the instruments’ observations were made. According to the table, only two of these instruments obtained\nspectroscopy data: VISIR at the European Southern Observatory, which made its observations in 2006, and TEXES at the\nGemini Observatory, which made its observations in later years (2007 and 2019).

Although the table indicates that TEXES at the Gemini Observatory collected spectroscopy data in\n2007 and 2019, the table also indicates that this type of data was collected in 2006 by VISIR at the European Southern\nObservatory. Because the VISIR data were collected in the previous year, the data obtained in 2007 by TEXES are not the\nearliest example of spectroscopy data included in Moses and team’s analysis of Neptune’s temperature.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants were “more than seven times likelier to characterize the\nmodified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing.” Because the modified songs had\nbeen changed by altering the timing of the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats\nmay play a crucial role in giving a song swing.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers “synchronized the offbeats” in the modified\nsongs, they also “delayed the downbeats” in those songs.

According to the text, Gálvez and colleagues found that the\nvenom used by C. granosus both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, a pathogen that, if ingested by C.\ngranosus, would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that E. coli is commonly found in\nspecies preyed on by C. granosus and, moreover, can withstand C. granosus’s digestive juices after ingestion, this would\nsuggest that C. granosus likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize E. coli to make E. coli-infected prey safe for\nconsumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, C. granosus’s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen’s\ngrowth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for C. granosus against E. coli that its digestive system\nwouldn’t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it\nmitigates risk during feeding.\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that E. coli doesn’t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for C. granosus even when\nvenom isn’t used would weaken rather than strengthen Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that a particular form of venom\nproduction spread in C. granosus in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that E.\ncoli isn’t actually a risk to C. granosus when consuming prey. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that C. granosus can\ndetect and avoid consuming E. coli-infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production\nis the primary factor that reduces C. granosus’s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary\npressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn’t clearly support the conclusion that C.\ngranosus’s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is\nincorrect because Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion focuses on C. granosus venom in relation to the risk of E. coli, and a\nfinding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don’t pose a\nrisk if consumed, wouldn’t be relevant to the conclusion that C. granosus’s particular form of venom production spread in the\nspecies in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion about a\ntrade-off in growing shorter varieties of corn. The text explains that plant specialists are working to develop shorter corn\nvarieties in an effort to improve yields. The text points out that although greater height in corn plants can lead to more ears\nof corn per plant, it also makes the stalks more likely to be damaged by strong winds before there is a chance to harvest the\ncorn. This presents a clear trade-off between potential yield (taller plants producing more ears per plant) and harvest\nreliability (shorter plants surviving until harvest time). Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that shorter corn\nvarieties, while possibly producing fewer ears per plant, would be more likely to survive until harvest time. This survival\nadvantage would result in improved yields of harvested corn because more plants would remain intact, thus offsetting the\npotential reduction in ears per shorter plant.\nChoice B is incorrect. According to the text, greater height makes cornstalks vulnerable to snapping or being uprooted in\nstrong winds, implying that taller plants—not shorter ones—have greater stability problems. The text provides no basis for\ninferring that shorter corn varieties would be more likely to be uprooted due to corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the\nopposite relationship between height and stability. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about\nthe land requirements of either shorter corn varieties or shorter wheat and rice varieties, much less make any comparisons.\nThe text mentions that plant breeders in the 1950s and ’60s created shorter varieties of wheat and rice with improved yields\nand that researchers are now exploring shorter corn varieties, but it doesn’t compare land-use requirements of these crops.\nChoice D is incorrect because the idea that shorter cornstalks would yield more ears of corn would contradict the\nrelationship between height and corn production described in the text. The text explicitly states that greater height allows\nindividual plants to produce more ears of corn, which suggests that shorter varieties would produce fewer ears per plant, not\nmore. The text therefore provides no basis for concluding that shorter varieties would begin developing more ears than the\ntaller varieties currently do.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the use of songs by the\nKwakwaka’wakw people to record and communicate ecological knowledge. The text indicates that some songs of the\nKwakwaka’wakw people of Canada’s Pacific Northwest region document how the people used terraced gardens in intertidal\nzones to cultivate clams for food. The text also explains that archaeological evidence shows increases in \"clam size and\nabundance\" that occurred along with the implementation of this cultivation method, suggesting the method’s efficacy in not\njust supporting clam yields but also improving them. It follows, then, that the use of intertidal terraced gardens, as described\nin the songs, allowed the ancestors of modern Kwakwaka’wakw people to maintain clams as a food source and to cultivate\nlarger and more numerous clams.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention anything about cultivation practices among non-Indigenous people in\nthe Pacific Northwest coastal region. Though the text conveys that archaeological evidence suggests that the clam\ncultivation practice mentioned in Kwakwaka’wakw people’s songs was efficacious when implemented, it gives no indication\nthat people other than the Kwakwaka’wakw adopted that practice. Choice C is incorrect because the text provides no\ninformation about the archaeological record as it pertains to Sakha and Kaluli songs and doesn’t suggest that there is less\ncorroboration of practices described in those songs than there is of the clam cultivation practice described in\nKwakwaka’wakw songs. The Sakha and Kaluli songs are mentioned early in the text only as examples of Indigenous songs\nthat contain ecological knowledge. Choice D is incorrect because archaeological evidence that clam size and abundance\nboth increased when Kwakwaka’wakw ancestors implemented intertidal terraced gardens provides information only about\nthe past use of that method and doesn’t suggest anything about present practices. The text indicates that knowledge of a\npast clam cultivation method is maintained in Kwakwaka’wakw songs but doesn’t indicate whether modern Kwakwaka’wakw\npeople use that or other fishing and farming practices used by their ancestors.",

    },
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion about\nwhitefly-induced defenses in tomato plants. According to the text, tomato plants produce airborne chemicals that prompt\nnearby tomato plants to increase their production of appropriate defensive chemicals, such as jasmonic acid in response to\nherbivory and salicylic acid in response to microbial infection. The text goes on to indicate that researchers concluded that\nwhiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that cause nearby plants to defend against microbial infection instead of\nherbivory from whiteflies. The graph shows that control tomato plants (plants that weren’t exposed to any chemicals from\nnearby tomato plants and weren’t subsequently infested with whiteflies) produced about 140 nanograms of jasmonic acid\nper gram of dry weight and about 120 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, which indicates the baseline levels\nof these defensive chemicals in tomato plants. The graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants\nproduced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when subsequently infested by whiteflies, which is\nmore than the amount produced by the control plants. This suggests that when infested with whiteflies, tomato plants that\nweren’t previously exposed to air from nearby whitefly-infested plants begin producing higher levels of jasmonic acid to\ndefend against the infestation. Finally, the graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants and then\nsubsequently infested by whiteflies produced approximately 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight (which\nis less than control plants did) and approximately 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more\nthan control plants did). This suggests that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit chemical signals that decrease nearby\nplants’ defenses against whitefly herbivory relative to baseline levels and redirect their defenses toward microbial infection,\nthereby supporting the researchers’ conclusion that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit airborne chemical signals that\ninduce nearby plants to preferentially defend against microbes even when experiencing herbivory from whiteflies.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the graph shows that tomato plants exposed to whitefly-infested plants produced less\njasmonic acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight vs. about 175 nanograms\nof salicylic acid per gram of dry weight), and although this might suggest that those plants are therefore better defended\nagainst microbial attack than against herbivory, this wouldn’t be sufficient to conclude that this is the case: without reference\nto the relative levels of defensive chemicals produced by the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be\nimpossible to conclude that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants either induces or diminishes these plants’ defenses\nto different kinds of threats. Furthermore, the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced\nabout 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry\nweight, not that they produced the same amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the\ndata in the graph. The graph shows that plants in all three conditions produced both jasmonic and salicylic acid, not that\nplants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produce no jasmonic acid at all. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph\nshows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produced about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of\ndry weight when infested, which is less than the amount produced by control plants (about 140 nanograms per gram of dry\nweight), and although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms\nof jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested (which is more than the amount produced by control plants) and\nabout 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than the approximately 120 nanograms per\ngram of dry weight produced by control plants), this wouldn’t support the researchers’ conclusion that plants exposed to air\nfrom whitefly-infested plants preferentially defend against microbial infection—that is, that they increase their levels of\nsalicylic acid and decrease their levels of jasmonic acid relative to control plants. Rather, the data would suggest that\nexposure to air from whitefly-infested plants reduces plants’ defenses against herbivory, but these data wouldn’t indicate\nthat whiteflies induce plants to redirect their defenses to guard against microbial infection. Furthermore, the data concerning\nplants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants merely indicate that these plants increase their defenses against both\nherbivory and microbial infection when infested by whiteflies.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by noting a common\nintuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which raises the question of what is the reason for being against lying.\nThe text then presents Pallikkathayil’s answer to this question: we have a duty to respect others’ agential interests (that is,\nwe have an obligation to allow people to exercise their free will in order to best serve their own ends), false beliefs constrain\nagency (the implication here being that people who are deceived about what is true are impeded in acting in their own best\ninterests), and so we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliberately deceive a person) unless\ndoing so prevents a greater limitation on someone’s agency or prevents some otherwise impermissible end (for example, it\nmight be morally permissible to lie to someone in the rare circumstance where a false belief would lead a person to act in\ntheir own best interest, and where they would not do so if they knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that\nPallikkathayil offers a potential justification for opposing lying based on respecting agency, while still allowing for exceptions\nin specific circumstances.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t focus on people’s lack of a principled way to identify circumstances where\nlying is permissible or indicate that Pallikkathayil’s argument resolves this specific problem. Rather, the text presents\nPallikkathayil’s argument that lies limit agency but may be permitted in very specific situations (to prevent a greater\nlimitation on someone’s agency or an otherwise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible arguments about\nwhy lies are undesirable but sometimes permissible. Choice C is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text.\nPallikkathayil’s argument, as described in the text, wouldn’t lead to an \"inviolable duty to speak truthfully.\" On the contrary, the\ntext explicitly states that Pallikkathayil’s position is that interfering with people developing accurate beliefs is wrong, except\nwhen such interference prevents either a more significant limitation on someone’s agency or an outcome that would be\nunacceptable for other reasons. This indicates that Pallikkathayil’s argument allows for some exceptions to the duty to\nspeak truthfully, making it not inviolable. Choice D is incorrect because Pallikkathayil’s argument doesn’t suggest that if it is\npermissible to lie in at least some circumstances, then it is unclear whether there are good reasons for opposing lying in any\ncircumstances. Instead, the text presents Pallikkathayil as offering a specific ground for opposing lying (respecting others’\nability to act in their own best interests) while qualifying that assertion by presenting a situation in which lying might\nsometimes be morally permissible.",

    "question_text": "A researcher conducted an experiment inspired by studies suggesting that people may benefit from feeling frightened in\ncertain circumstances, such as when watching scary movies or visiting haunted attractions. The researcher recruited several\nparticipants and had them walk through a local haunted house attraction. Immediately after exiting the attraction, each\nparticipant completed a survey about their experience. Based on the survey responses, the researcher claims that feeling\nfrightened in controlled situations can boost a person’s mood and confidence.\nWhich quotation from a participant would best illustrate the researcher’s claim?\nA. “After I came out of the haunted house, I felt very accomplished and less stressed.”\nB. “My friends kept laughing as we were walking through the haunted house.”\nC. “The haunted house was scary at first, but I knew everyone was just acting, so I felt less scared after a few minutes.”\nD. “The sense of relief I felt at the end of the haunted house was similar to the feelings I have when I finish a scary movie.”",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the research team’s\nconclusion about anatomical features and speech detection in dogs. The text explains that a team of researchers monitored\nthe brain activity of dogs while the dogs listened to three recordings: one of spoken Spanish, one of spoken Hungarian, and\none of scrambled fragments that weren’t recognizable as human speech. The text then states that the team concluded that\ndifferences in dogs’ anatomical features may affect their ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. The finding that\nlonger-headed dogs exhibited a greater difference in brain activity when listening to the speech recordings (in Spanish or\nHungarian) versus the nonspeech (scrambled) recording compared with shorter-headed dogs would establish an\nassociation between an anatomical feature (head length) and responses (as measured by brain activity) to speech versus\nnonspeech. This observed relationship between head length and brain activity patterns during exposure to speech and\nnonspeech would support the team’s conclusion.\nChoice A is incorrect because it describes a finding about dogs’ responses (as indicated by brain activity) to hearing their\nrespective familiar languages rather than dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech, which is what the team’s\nconclusion specifically addresses. Moreover, this finding pertains to only one anatomical type (long-headed dogs), so it\nwouldn’t support the conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech.\nChoice C is incorrect because it describes a finding involving a comparison between long-headed dogs listening to\nnonspeech and short-headed dogs listening to speech, which wouldn’t provide enough information to support the\nresearchers’ conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. To\nsupport that conclusion, the finding would need to show how dogs with different anatomical features (for example, long-\nheaded and short-headed dogs) respond to recordings of speech as well as recordings of nonspeech. Choice D is incorrect\nbecause it describes a finding about dogs’ ability to distinguish between a familiar language and an unfamiliar one, not\nbetween speech and nonspeech. While this finding does compare dogs with different anatomical features (longer-headed\nvs. shorter-headed ones), it focuses on language recognition (Spanish vs. Hungarian) rather than the ability to distinguish\nspeech from nonspeech, which is what the team’s conclusion specifically addresses.",

    "question_text": "The Haitian Declaration of Independence was issued in 1804, bringing to an end the revolution against colonial France that\nbegan in 1791. Written in French, which was not the first language of most Haitians but which was used throughout Europe\nas the language of international diplomacy, the declaration notes that Haiti will not bring rebellion to other Caribbean nations,\npromises to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors—widely understood as a reassurance to the United States—and sets up\nHaiti as an example for future struggles against colonizers (an implicit reference to the many colonies then found in the\nAmericas).

The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European\ndiplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included \"a reassurance to the United States,\" and made implicit\nreferences to colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declaration that were largely irrelevant to the\nHaitian people, we can assume that the Haitian people were not the only audience for this document.\nChoice A is incorrect.

According to the text, many of\nRichard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than\nrealistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his\nwork in honor of Ida B.

      }

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the\nUltra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is\ncalculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload\ncapacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T.\nAdditionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than\nthe Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding\nforce to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the\ngraph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the\ninformation in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than\nthe Yale Model T.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T\nweigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand\nhas a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the\ntwo robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale\nModel T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’\nconclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes\na similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the\nPermanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-Fast Robot\nHand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force\nthan the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover,  information about the\nPermanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot\nHand and the Yale Model T.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a conclusion about the role of fynbos roots in maintaining the border with\nthe Afro-temperate forest that can be reasonably inferred from the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos have\n\"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil.\" The text then\ndescribes an experiment where forest tree seedlings grown in plots isolated from fynbos roots grew at a rate fiv   e times\ngreater than seedlings in areas near fynbos roots. This strongly suggests that fynbos roots are depleting soil nutrients to\nsuch an extent that forest plants can’t get enough nutrients from that soil to flourish, thereby hindering the formation of any\nsignificant \"transition space\" between the habitats and helping keep the border between them sharp.\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that fynbos roots physically damage the root systems of forest\nplants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as having \"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out\nover large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil.\" This description establishes that fynbos roots are specialized for\nefficient nutrient absorption. The experiment then confirms this function of the roots by showing that forest seedlings\n\"isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate fiv   e times greater\" than those near fynbos roots. This result\ndemonstrates that when forest seedlings don’t have to compete with the nutrient-absorbing fynbos roots, they grow much\nbetter. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the fynbos and the Afro-temperate forest are distinct from,\nand adjacent to, each other and that there is \"almost no transition space\" (area of mixed fynbos and forest plants), the\nexperiment shows that forest plants can grow in soil occupied by fynbos roots, just not very well. So, the idea that the fynbos\nroots physically obstruct forest plants is unsupported by the text. Choice D is incorrect because it directly contradicts the\ntext’s claim that fynbos roots absorb nutrients from, and therefore deplete, the soil they’re in, and furthermore, nothing in the\ntext suggests that the habitat of the fynbos is harsh in general.",

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because the quotation directly illustrates Patty trying hard to convince Mrs. Trent to allow the\ngroup to continue sharing a room. The phrase \"Patty did use all the diplomacy at her command\" explicitly shows her making\na determined effort to be persuasive. The quotation further details Patty’s specific tactics: she \"dwelt touchingly upon their\nlong friendship, and their sorrow at being separated.\" These details illustrate the claim by suggesting that Patty carefully\ncrafted and delivered an emotional appeal to Mrs. Trent about the effects of changing the group’s rooming situation.\nChoice A is incorrect because although the quotation describes a reaction by Mrs. Trent, it does not reveal anything about\nthe events or conversation that might have prompted this reaction. Instead of depicting Patty’s efforts to be persuasive\nduring such a conversation, the quotation focuses on Mrs. Trent’s character traits; specifically, it describes the relationship\nbetween her \"sense of humour\" and her \"sense of justice.\" While the latter trait may be relevant to Patty’s situation, the\nquotation doesn’t show the extent of her efforts to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the change in rooming arrangements.\nChoice B is incorrect because this quotation describes the reaction of a group of three students immediately after an\nencounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the outcome of an implied conversation but does not provide any evidence about the\ntopic or nature of the conversation itself, and therefore does not illustrate Patty’s efforts during a conversation to convince\nMrs. Trent to change her mind about the rooming situation.

        "D": "To recount fond memories of an afternoon spent in nature with a certain writer"
      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. In the first part of the text, the\nspeaker addresses Paul Laurence Dunbar’s ability to understand people (he has “read the hearts and souls of men” and\nwritten of their “joy and mirth”). In the second part of the text, the speaker describes Dunbar’s thorough understanding of the\nnatural world (he has read “the language of the flowers” and engaged with “the little brook”). Thus, the text mainly praises\nDunbar for being especially perceptive about people and nature.\nChoice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the “hearts and souls of men” and the “language\nof flowers” to convey Dunbar’s ability to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read any of\nthese things or has read a great deal about them. Choice C is incorrect because the text notes how well Dunbar has made\nsense of the topics he’s written about but doesn’t address any specific parts of Dunbar’s writing process beyond the\nsuggestion that he used a pen. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on Dunbar’s understanding of people and\nnature as expressed in his writing. Nothing in the text suggests that the speaker is recalling a particular afternoon actually\nspent in nature with Dunbar; even if there had been a shared experience, the text isn’t focused on reminiscing.",

    "question_text": "Archaeologist Veronica Waweru visited the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. While exploring there, Waweru noticed\nmany rows of shallow pits carved into stone. Waweru believed the pits could have been used as game boards to play ancient\nversions of mancala, a two-person strategy game that is still popular today. Some of the more recent pits were carved on top\nof older pits. This led Waweru to think that the game was played at the site for a long time.\nAccording to the text, why does Waweru think that mancala was played at the site for a long time?\nA. Some of the newer pits were carved on top of the older pits.\nB. She noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone.\nC. She discovered the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.\nD.

        "D": "Some of the pits were shallow and others were quite deep."
      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Veronica Waweru’s thinking that is supported by the text.\nThe text begins by discussing Waweru’s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been\nplayed at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone.\nThe text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued\nto play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the\npresence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played\nat the site for a long time.\nChoice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru \"noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone,\" this\nobservation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not\nspecifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely\nsuggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used\nfor that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to\nthink that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru\nfound the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn’t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had\nbeen played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was\nplayed, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any variation in\nthe depth of the pits. The text only describes the pits collectively as shallow and doesn’t indicate that the depth of the pits\nfactored into Waweru’s thinking about how long the site had been used for playing mancala.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the second research\nteam’s hypothesis about how a fish’s head shape affects the fish’s ability to detect obstructions. The text explains that fish\ndetect obstructions using water vortices and that testing by Yanagisuru, Akanyeti, and Liao showed that fish with wide heads\nstruggle to distinguish medium-sized vortices from general turbulence in the water. Based on this finding, a second research\nteam hypothesized that in low-visibility conditions, wider-headed fish would be less effective at detecting obstructions than\nnarrower-headed fish. The finding that wider-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into obstructions more often than narrower-\nheaded dusky smooth-hound fish did under the specified conditions (low visibility with medium-sized vortices) would directly\nsupport the second team’s hypothesis.\nChoice A is incorrect because it would provide only partial support for the second research team’s hypothesis. While this\nfinding shows that wide-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into many obstructions, it provides no comparison with narrow-\nheaded fish. The hypothesis specifically predicts a difference in detection ability between fish with wider heads and those\nwith narrower heads, so supporting evidence would need to include data from both head types to allow for this comparison.\nChoice B is incorrect because it would not support the second research team’s hypothesis comparing obstruction detection\nbetween fish with wide heads and those with narrow heads. Instead, it examines variation within a single narrow-headed\nspecies, which would not address the hypothesis about differences between fish with wider and narrower head shapes.\nChoice D is incorrect because this finding would contradict rather than support the second research team’s hypothesis. The\nhypothesis predicts that wider-headed fish will be less likely to detect obstructions than narrower-headed fish in low-visibility\nconditions, which would result in wider-headed fish bumping into obstructions more frequently.

The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen\nfertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019).

    "question_text": "In addition to her technical skill and daring feats, American stunt pilot Bessie Coleman was also known for dazzling the\ncrowds that came to watch her air shows in the 1920s with her exuberant personality. During her career, she was careful and\npurposeful about how she crafted her public persona. An aviation researcher has claimed that Coleman intentionally defied\nsocial norms of the time by how she chose to present herself to the public.\nWhich quotation from an article about Coleman would most directly support the aviation researcher’s claim?\nA. “For her air shows, Coleman frequently used the Curtiss JN-4, or ‘Jenny,’ which at that time was one of the most well-\nknown types of planes.”\nB. “While Coleman was beloved by spectators for her charisma, she had a more complicated relationship with her\nmanagers and staff, who at times found her behavior too impulsive and demanding.”\nC. “Coleman once considered leaving her career as a stunt pilot to focus her efforts on giving speeches, which she felt\nwould better support her public image.”\nD. “Although female pilots were typically expected to wear traditional but impractical attire that included dresses or skirts,\nphotographs of Coleman show her wearing pants and leather jackets.”",

Karla A. Camacho-Cruz and colleagues assessed delta 15-N values in the\nseagrass Thalassia testudinum from sites on Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with intermediate tourism development, including\nAkumal Bay and Tulum, and low tourism development, including Mahahual and Xahuayxol, throughout 2016 and 2017.

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the underlined conclusion. The text\naccompanying the table states that delta 15-N values (a measure of the ratio of two nitrogen isotopes) can be used as an\nindirect means of measuring the ratio of human wastewater to water from uncontaminated sources—the higher the delta 15-\nN values, the greater the presence of human wastewater. The text goes on to mention an experiment conducted by\nCamacho-Cruz and colleagues measuring delta 15-N values in seagrass on the Yucatan peninsula at several sites, four of\n15\n1514\nwhich are presented in the table accompanying the text. Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Bay and Tulum, had\nintermediate tourism development, and two others, Mahahual and Xahuayxol, had low tourism development. It is reasonable\nto infer that sites with intermediate tourism have a greater human presence than those with low tourism and therefore are\nsubject to greater amounts of wastewater and exhibit higher delta 15-N values in seagrass. However, Camacho-Cruz and\ncolleagues found that the increase in delta 15-N values was not constant. The table supports this conclusion because the\ntwo intermediate-tourism sites (Akumal Bay and Tulum) had delta 15-N values that fluctuated considerably—both had higher\ndelta 15-N values than the two low-tourism sites (Mahahual and Xahuayxol) in October 2016 and October 2017, but in\nFebruary 2017 the delta 15-N values for the intermediate-tourism sites dropped significantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low-\ntourism site, had a higher delta 15-N value for that period). The fluctuations in values in Akumal Bay and Tulum support the\nconclusion that these sites experienced influxes of human wastewater intermittently.\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table: in February 2017 the delta 15-N value in Akumal\nBay was higher than the delta 15-N value in Xahuayxol, not lower. Choice B is incorrect because the absence of data for delta\n15-N levels in Akumal Bay in February 2016 would neither prove nor disprove that the presence of human wastewater at\nAkumal Bay and Tulum was not constant. Despite the unavailable data, there is still enough information to conclude that\ndelta 15-N levels at both sites fluctuated significantly and that influxes of human wastewater therefore happened\nintermittently. Choice C is incorrect because a constancy in delta 15-N values would not indicate that the influx of human\nwastewater was intermittent, but rather the opposite. Moreover, the two periods selected are not indicative of general trends\nin the whole table (for example, the values fluctuated significantly in Akumal Bay between February 2017 and October 2017,\nand in Tulum between October 2016 and February 2017).",

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a detail that, if true, would most directly support the researcher’s claim\nabout the difficulty of determining olive tree age by ring counting. The text explains that for many trees, counting the dark\nrings visible in a tree stump is a reliable method for determining the tree’s age. However, if olive trees have growth rings that\nare difficult to see, it would be hard to count the individual rings. Therefore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or\nimpossible to use for olive trees. This directly supports the researcher’s claim that the ring-counting method often can’t be\nused for olive trees because it identifies a specific characteristic of olive trees that could render this approach impracticable.\nChoice A is incorrect because the probable age of the oldest olive tree doesn’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work for\ndetermining olive tree age. The older age of some olive trees might make counting more tedious but doesn’t pose an\ninsurmountable obstacle to adopting the method. The researcher’s claim is about the feasibility of the ring-counting method\nfor olive trees, not about the potential impracticality of employing this method for particularly long-lived trees. Choice B is\nincorrect because the fact that narrow growth rings might indicate harsh growing conditions has no direct bearing on the\nclaim that counting rings often can’t be used to determine olive tree age. It is possible that growth rings that are too narrowly\nspaced might be difficult to count, but the researcher’s claim relates to the inapplicability of the ring-counting method to olive\ntrees in general rather than to olive trees that have experienced harsh conditions. Moreover, as long as they are visible, even\nnarrow growth rings might permit the ring-counting method to be used to determine tree age. Choice D is incorrect because\nthe ideal climate conditions for olive trees don’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work as a method for determining their\nage. While growing conditions might affect ring formation patterns, the simple fact that olive trees thrive in hot, dry\nenvironments doesn’t directly address why the conventional method of counting rings would be ineffective for determining\ntheir age.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of\ncompeting claims about the origins of red velvet cake. The text states that the origins of the recipe for red velvet cake \"are\nunclear.\" The text then presents four different entities that claim to have created the first red velvet cake recipe: a Dallas\nbakery (1860s), the Adams Extract Co. (1930s), a US hotel (1930s), and a Canadian department store (1930s). Lastly, the\ntext states that \"no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others.\" Given this information, it most\nlogically follows that it’s not possible to determine who baked the first red velvet cake, as there is insufficient evidence to\ndetermine which claim, if any, is correct.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information indicating that red velvet cake existed before the 1860s.\nAccording to the text, the earliest claim for creating red velvet cake comes from a bakery in Dallas, Texas, that asserted it\ndeveloped the first recipe for the cake at the time of the bakery’s opening in the 1860s. There’s no textual support for the\nconclusion that the cake existed before this earliest claimed date, since the text presents only competing claims starting\nfrom the 1860s and extending to the 1930s without evidence of earlier origins. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t\nsupport the conclusion that none of the supposed inventors of red velvet cake likely invented the cake. The text states that\nmultiple entities claim to have invented the recipe and that \"no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over\nthe others.\" This lack of decisive evidence doesn’t logically lead to the conclusion that all the claims are false; it merely\nindicates that the cake’s true origins can’t be determined with the available evidence.

In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten\nbuilt a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his\nseries of “slab” paintings from that decade.  Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,”\nsignaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift\nrepresents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture,\nboth Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA. any tool that a painter uses to create an artwork is capable of creating gestures.\nB.

The finding that many visitors who were surveyed indicated that the\nvirtual tours actually convinced them to plan an in-person visit directly contradicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in-\nperson visits, virtual tours actively encouraged them, providing strong support for the administrators’ claim that the initial\nconcerns were unfounded.\nChoice B is incorrect. The finding that most surveyed visitors were unaware of the virtual tours before their first in-person\nvisit wouldn’t directly address whether virtual tours affect decisions about in-person visits.

Whether visitors live in Florence or elsewhere would suggest nothing about whether\nvirtual tours influenced their choice. This information is irrelevant to the administrators’ claim about the relationship between\nvirtual tours and in-person visits. Choice D is incorrect because visitors’ intentions to view virtual tours after their in-person\nvisit wouldn’t address the initial concerns that virtual tours might make in-person visits seem unnecessary.

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion about the genealogy of Arthurian legends.\nThe text establishes a chronology of Arthurian sources, with Vita Sancti Cadoci composed in the 11th century (the 1000s),\nGeoffrey of Monmouth’s History written in the 1130s, Wace’s Roman de Brut in 1155, and Culhwch and Olwen in the second\nhalf of the 12th century (1150–1200). Importantly, the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffrey’s History, Wace added\n\"the famous Round Table\" to it. If Wace introduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element\nwas not present in earlier works. This suggests that the Arthurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci, which was\nwritten before both Geoffrey’s and Wace’s works, would not have featured the Round Table.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses several works that include legends about a character, King Arthur, but\ndoesn’t address the historical accuracy of the stories in those works or suggest that the creation of Culhwch and Olwen was\nrelevant to any other works’ accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that works containing stories of\nthe Round Table were available to Geoffrey of Monmouth when he composed his History in the 1130s, whether he was aware\nof them or not; it instead suggests that the idea of the Round Table wasn’t introduced until more than a decade later, when\nWace added it to Geoffrey’s History. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the Arthurian legends in Geoffrey\nof Monmouth’s History differ from those in Wace’s Roman de Brut in that Wace added the idea of the Round Table, the text\ndoesn’t compare the overall content of the Arthurian legends in the two works and doesn’t indicate anything about the overall\ncontent of the legends in Culhwch and Olwen.",

This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic\n(unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually “invites classification as Indigenous\nart.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity.\nChoice A is incorrect.

    "question_text": "Arthropods—brine shrimp, hawk moths, and many other invertebrate animals—have a nervous system made up of a brain,\nnerve cord, and other nerves. Researchers have gained insights about this system in ancient arthropods from traces found in\nvarious fossils. For example, in a study of two fossils of the extinct arthropod species Mollisonia symmetrica, Javier Ortega-\nHernández, James Weaver, and team observed clear signs of a nerve cord. They also saw possible indications of a\nsynganglion, a brain-like mass of nerves. Researchers hope to identify more features of the nervous systems of prehistoric\narthropods as additional fossils are found.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\nA. There are several similarities between the brains of hawk moths and the brains of brine shrimp.\nB. Fossil evidence can contribute to the understanding of the nervous system in ancient arthropods.\nC. Newly discovered fossils suggest that ancient hawk moths and ancient brine shrimp had spines.\nD.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text states that researchers\nhave used fossils to learn about the nervous systems of ancient arthropods. It then provides a specific example of\nresearchers studying fossils of Mollisonia symmetrica and finding evidence of a nerve cord and possibly a synganglion (a\nbrain-like mass of nerves). The text concludes by noting that researchers hope to discover more features of prehistoric\narthropods’ nervous systems \"as additional fossils are found.\" Thus, the main idea of the text is that fossil evidence can\ncontribute to the understanding of the nervous system in ancient arthropods.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t compare the brains of hawk moths and brine shrimp. These animals are\nmerely mentioned as examples of arthropods in the opening sentence, and the text doesn’t go on to discuss any similarities\nbetween their brains. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses nervous systems, not spines, in ancient arthropods,\nand it doesn’t specifically mention findings about ancient hawk moths or brine shrimp. Choice D is incorrect. While the text\nconcludes by noting that researchers aim to discover additional characteristics of prehistoric arthropods’ nervous systems\nas more fossils are uncovered, this statement doesn’t suggest that researchers need to focus on finding more fossils.\nRather, it simply indicates that researchers expect to learn more about this topic as additional fossils are discovered.\nMoreover, the statement is just a detail that supports the main idea; it’s not the main idea itself.",

In the quotation, Hedda says that she wants “to have power to mould a human destiny,” or shape a person’s\nfate, just as the text indicates. Additionally, the phrase “for once in my life” suggests that Hedda feels that she has never\nbeen able to shape anyone’s life, including her own, supporting the text’s assertion that she “is unable to freely determine her\nown future.”\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation shows Hedda being uncertain about what to do with her own life, not wanting to\ninfluence another person’s fate. Choice C is incorrect because while this quotation shows Hedda’s interest in finding out\nwhether she has any power over another character, it doesn’t clearly show that she wants to influence that person’s fate. In\nthis quotation, Hedda seems to have inferred or concluded (“then”) that she doesn’t have any influence over the person to\nwhom she’s speaking, and she’s asking that person to confirm her lack of influence. Choice D is incorrect because this\nquotation expresses Hedda’s belief that a man should be true to his principles, not her desire to influence another person’s\nfate.",

    "question_text": "In the 1970s, a roughly 60,000-year-old piece of hyena bone marked with nine notches was discovered at a site in western\nFrance once inhabited by Neanderthals. Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating\nnumbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information.\nThe notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were\nmade with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by\none individual as a means of counting something.\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?\nA.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced\nparallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on \"decorative art\" at another Neanderthal site, it would\nsuggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool.\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim:\nassuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the\nidea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the\nunderlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything\nabout the use of either artifact.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of patterns of linguistic distribution in New\nYork City. The text explains how Chinese immigrants in New York City tend to settle in different boroughs based on their\nregion of origin in China: those from north China (Mandarin speakers) typically settle in Queens, while those from south\nChina (Cantonese or Fuzhounese speakers) typically settle in Manhattan. This pattern demonstrates that the regional\nlanguage distribution in China (north versus south) has reproduced itself in New York City (Queens versus Manhattan).\nTherefore, it can be reasonably inferred that correlations between languages and regions in one country can replicate\nthemselves when citizens of that country emigrate to a new country.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss rates of language change.

The speaker emphasizes the calmness of the\nscene, noting that the \"race of wind is stilled\" and the atmosphere is sleepy (\"slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world\"),\nand then indicates that the calmness prompts thoughts of how old age might be \"sweet\" and \"quiet\" and \"gracious in retreat\"\nafter \"a windy youth\" with \"storms.\" Thus, the main idea is that the tranquility of a port in the evening can lead a person to\nappreciate the potential stillness of old age.\nChoice B is incorrect because the speaker isn’t discussing the difficulty of bringing a ship into port but describing the\ncalmness of the port at night. And rather than suggesting that old age involves struggles, the speaker suggests that after \"a\nwindy youth\" with \"storms\" to be weathered, old age will be \"sweet,\" \"quiet,\" and \"gracious\"—that is, old age will be tranquil like\na port at night.

Thus, the finding would support the text’s conclusion that a store context associated with inexpensive goods\nmoderates the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their earlier experiments.\nChoice B is incorrect because if Sevilla and Townsend found that at both upscale and inexpensive stores, participants judged\njewelry spaced far apart to be less valuable than jewelry spaced close together, that would show the opposite of the effect\nthe researchers observed in their earlier experiments, not show that an inexpensive store context merely moderates, or\nlessens, that effect. Choice C is incorrect because this finding wouldn’t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed\nin their initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced\nclose together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests\non determining the difference in jewelry items’ perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then\ncomparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a\nfinding that compares perceptions of the jewelry items’ value between the two stores but for only one type of spacing\ncondition at a time wouldn’t provide information about the degree of difference between spacing conditions within each type\nof store context. Choice D is incorrect because this finding wouldn’t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in\ntheir initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced\nclose together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests\non determining the difference in jewelry items’ perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then\ncomparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a\nfinding that compares perceptions of the relative value of jewelry items between the two stores and for only one type of\nspacing condition at a time wouldn’t provide information about the degree of difference between spacing conditions within\neach type of store context.",

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of consumer expectations and the\nstruggles delivery companies face. The text states that while consumers expect ever-faster delivery of goods, delivery\ncompanies \"continue to struggle with last-mile logistics.\" The text further explains that innovations aimed at addressing this\nchallenge have a tendency to cause complications of their own. Because escalating consumer demands for speed are\npaired with persistent, complex delivery obstacles and new problems arising from attempted solutions, it logically follows\nthat consumer expectations for delivery times may be exceeding what companies can feasibly provide.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea of delivery volumes at all and makes it clear that companies\nare already aware of and trying to address consumers’ expectations for delivery. Further, the challenge presented at the end\nof the text relates to new problems that tend to arise with solutions for logistical problems, not to a lack of understanding of\nwhat consumers want or how delivery volumes fluctuate. Choice C is incorrect. The text does suggest that rapid delivery is\nimportant for customer satisfaction and thus is a beneficial investment for companies, but that idea is already presented in\nthe beginning of the text and doesn’t logically follow as a conclusion from the information about innovations companies are\nexploring to solve last-mile logistics problems; the idea that the potential solutions tend to introduce new issues points to\nthe feasibility of meeting consumer expectations, not to the general fact that it would be beneficial to reduce delivery times.\nChoice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there may be insufficient incentive for delivery companies to try\nto solve last-mile logistics problems—on the contrary, the text directly indicates that delivery companies are already actively\npursuing innovations to try to address those problems, citing the example of the use of aerial drones, even though the\ninnovations can introduce new complications.",

      }
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of\nthe poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. In this quotation, the\nspeaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other\nwords, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each,\ndeparting”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole\nquotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the\nambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing”\nindicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by\nregretful reflection.\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful\nreflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has\noccurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figur  ative way of saying that the speaker has\nheard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of\nanticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that\nthe speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a\nparticular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this\nquotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of\nanticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities.",

Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia\ncaninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these\nsemitransparent rocks benefited the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S.\ncaninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because  it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species\nneed sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out.\nEkwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were\nsemitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was\nlonger than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as\nthe text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in\ngreater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity\nand are thus able to retain more moisture.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other\nsuch species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text\nexplains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than\nspecimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the\nmoss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath\nsemitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a\ncomparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative\nthickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that would best support Granito and Álvarez’s claim that\nfermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble fiber\nand raffinose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the\nbody to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of\nsoluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation\nimproves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body’s ability to extract\nnutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would\nlikely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and Álvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect\nbecause the text doesn’t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food’s digestibility or\nlevel of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn’t\nprovide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is\nincorrect because Granito and Álvarez’s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that\nnonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that\nthe role of the cooking method could be significant when it comes to nutrition; further, the finding wouldn’t address the\nbeans’ digestibility.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of the role of gift giving among members of\nguilds in early modern London. According to the text, members of these guilds participated in a culture where giving gifts\n\"both signaled and conferred social status\"—that is, it indicated people’s social standing and also gave them social standing\n—and occurred in the forms of both philanthropic gifting (donations for humanitarian purposes) by large guilds, which much\nresearch has focused on, and the gifting of handmade items between craft guild members, which Kilburn-Toppin focuses on.\nThe text indicates that Kilburn-Toppin characterizes craft guild members as people who made and consumed items and\nwere \"highly discerning,\" or were careful judges of quality. Because gift giving benefited one’s status and if craft guild\nmembers were particularly attentive to quality, it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds—between people who\nhad high standards for items they made and for items they received—may have been a way for members to maintain and\nenhance their professional reputations, or their professional statuses, among their peers.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes the idea that members of guilds participated in gift giving both to display\nand receive social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the \"highly discerning\" members of craft\nguilds had to do with the members’ interest in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the practice of gifting\nthose items within the craft guilds was intended to limit knowledge of materials and techniques to the members of those\nguilds. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between \"ostentatious,\" or very showy, and \"prosaic,\" or\nordinary, gifts and because the characterization at the end of the text pertains specifically to the gifting of handmade items\nindicative of great taste, not prosaic items, between members of craft guilds.

Choice C is incorrect because finding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises\nwould not support Stöger and her team’s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from\nthe giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record\nlow-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings.\nChoice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support\nStöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different\nspecies could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could not conclude anything about the function of\ngiraffe humming from a finding that some other animals in zoos also hum.",

    "question_text": "The following text is from Edith Nesbit’s 1902 novel Five Children and It. Five young siblings have just moved with their\nparents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House.\nIt was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite\nannoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork\non the roof and coping was like an architect’s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in\nsight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day\nby an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\nA. Although their parents believe the house has several drawbacks, the children are enchanted by it.\nB. The children don’t like the house nearly as much as their parents do.\nC. Each member of the family admires a different characteristic of the house.\nD. The house is beautiful and well built, but the children miss their old home in London.",

The text lists complaints about the house made by the mother and father, but then it says that\nthe children thought the house was a \"Fairy Palace\" and \"Earthly Paradise.\"\nChoice B is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. It describes how the mother and father dislike the house and says\nthe children think the house seems like paradise. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t what the text says. Only the children are\nsaid to admire the house; mother and father both complain about the house. Choice D is incorrect. The text states the\nopposite of this. It tells us the house was ugly and poorly built (\"an architect’s nightmare\") and suggests the children were\ntired of London.",

    "question_text": "Many archaeologists will tell you that categorizing excavated fragments of pottery by style, period, and what objects they\nbelong to relies not only on standard criteria, but also on instinct developed over years of practice. In a recent study, however,\nresearchers trained a deep-learning computer model on thousands of images of pottery fragments and found that it could\ncategorize them as accurately as a team of expert archaeologists. Some archaeologists have expressed concern that they\nmight be replaced by such computer models, but the researchers claim that outcome is highly unlikely.\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ claim?\nA. In the researchers’ study, the model was able to categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the\narchaeologists could.\nB. In the researchers’ study, neither the model nor the archeologists were able to accurately categorize all the pottery\nfragments that were presented.\nC.

      }

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim that\narchaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold\nthat categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience,\nresearchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the\nhumans can—a finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won’t be needed any longer. If\nsurvey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other\nimportant tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the\nimportant things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace\nhuman archaeologists.\nChoice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more\nquickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be\nreplaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work\nnot only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer\nmodel and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn’t support the\nresearchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some\narchaeologists are worried because the computer model’s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether\nboth were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results\nshowing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the\nresearchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special\ntraining in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer\nmodels’ success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.",

    "question_text": "To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting\nto obtain precise measurements of the shrimps’ burrows. Resin casting involves completely filling an empty burrow with a\nliquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying\nthe burrow.
