The left-hand side of the equation can be factored by finding two numbers whose sum is 3 and whose product is 2, which gives (x + 2)(x + 1) = 0. Setting each factor equal to 0 yields x + 2 = 0 and x + 1 = 0, and solving for x yields x = –2 or x = –1. These values of x can be substituted for x in the equation y = –x – 1 to find the corresponding y-values: y = –(–2) – 1 = 2 – 1 = 1 and y = –(–1) – 1 = 1 – 1 = 0. It follows that (–2, 1) and (–1, 0) are the solutions to the given system of equations. Therefore, (x, y) = (–2, 1), (x, y) = (–1, 0), and y + y = 1 + 0 = 1. Choice A is incorrect.

According to Moore’s law, every 2 years, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to double. Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double  times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as .
