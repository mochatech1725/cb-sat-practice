    'Information and Ideas Inferences Difficulty Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger. Hard Question ID 068f939b ID: 068f939b The ancient Greek concept of “mimesis,” a term used in the works of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art—visual, performance, or literary art that aims to depict the real world—is a foundational concept of the Western philosophy of aesthetics. Mimesis is typically translated as “imitation” in modern editions of ancient Greek texts, but scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: “imitation” implies that art merely copies—and is thus by definition entirely derivative of—a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating “mimesis” thusly obscures the multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality. Which statement, if true, would most directly support the claim by Halliwell presented in the text? dramatic impersonation, and the mim- root came to be generally associated with the musical and poetic arts by the fifth century BCE. viewer or listener. Plato’s discussions of art until Cratylus, a relatively late work. Aristotle suggests that mimesis can refer to art’s capacity to envision hypothetical conditions that could, but don’t yet, exist.',

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement that would support Halliwell’s claim that "imitation" is an overly simplified translation of the word "mimesis" in the context of ancient Greek philosophical discussions of representational art and that, because it suggests a view of art as merely copying things that exist in reality, the translation obscures the fact that Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality in varied ways. If Plato’s works tend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mere imitation), while Aristotle’s works suggest that the term "mimesis" can refer to art’s ability to show conditions that don’t currently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the term "mimesis" means more than just "imitation" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship between art and reality. Choice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos first being used in drama and the root mim- coming to be associated with music and poetry wouldn’t indicate anything about the meaning of the specific term "mimesis" as it was used by ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on SAT Reading and Writing',

    'Command of Evidence',
    'Information and Ideas Command of Evidence Difficulty Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the specific term is an oversimplification. Choice B is incorrect because the issue of art’s psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is related to reality, so the idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn’t have any bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of that term oversimplifies the relationship between art and reality. Further, this idea would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the multifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art’s relation to reality. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that Plato discussed aesthetics in his early works but didn’t use the term "mimesis" until later doesn’t give any indication of how Plato or any other ancient Greek philosophers understood the relation between art and reality, so it would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the term "mimesis" is oversimplified and fails to reflect the varied ways the philosophers understood that relationship. Hard Question ID 602b47c7 ID: 602b47c7 Biologists have predicted that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature, but this hadn’t been tested in mountain environments. Ornithologist Sahas Barve studied feathers from 249 songbird species inhabiting different elevations—and thus experiencing different temperatures—in the Himalaya Mountains. He found that feathers of high-elevation species not only have a greater proportion of warming downy sections to flat and smooth sections than do feathers of low-elevation species, but high-elevation species’ feathers also tend to be longer, providing a thicker layer of insulation. Which choice best states the main idea of the text? temperature than do the feathers of other species, contradicting previous predictions. support to a general prediction. sections, complicating an earlier hypothesis. by feather length than feather structure, challenging an established belief.',

    'Choice B is the best answer. The text describes how Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, which supports the general prediction that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice A is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to contradict previous predictions. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice C is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to “complicate an earlier hypothesis.” In fact, the study supports the earlier prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t compare the importance of feather length and feather structure, and it doesn’t say that Barve’s study challenges any established beliefs.

Caron and colleagues claim that these are the oldest jellyfish fossils ever discovered. In the past twenty years, two sites in China and the United States have yielded fossils of a similar age that some experts believe are most likely jellyfish due to their shapes and the appearance of projecting tentacles. But Caron and colleagues argue that the apparent tentacles are in fact the comb rows of ctenophores, gelatinous animals that are only distantly related to jellyfish.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement that, if true, would most directly weaken Caron and colleagues’ claim that the apparent tentacles in the Chinese and American fossils are actually ctenophore comb rows. If the fossils are so poorly preserved that they cannot be conclusively identified as either organism, neither the claim that they are jellyfish nor, as Caron claims, that they are ctenophores would be supported. Choice A is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. These fossils are said to be "of a similar age" to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores after the Cambrian would have any bearing on whether the Cambrian fossils from the US and China are ctenophores. Choice C is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in Canada) would affect whether the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish.

Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play’s refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue’s immense and intricate layout generates.

    'Choice C is the best answer. The text says that the production’s use of its large, winding space has a very specific effect on the audience. Given that the space itself is so important to creating this effect, it would be difficult to reproduce the production in a different space. Choice A is incorrect. The fact that the venue is in New York City isn’t connected to the experimental nature of the performance. It’s the size of the venue, not its location in New York, that affects the theatrical experience. Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that audience members are disappointed because they can’t see the entire production. In fact, it suggests that that’s an important part of the experience.

In humans, they are functionally important within the hippocampus, a brain structure that supports complex cognitive processes. When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus—an animal known for its intelligence—were announced in 2022, the confirmation of a LINE transposon in Octopus vulgaris and Octopus bimaculoides genomes prompted researchers to hypothesize that that transposon family is tied to a species’ capacity for advanced cognition.

    'Choice A is the best answer. The text says that LINE transposons are important in the human hippocampus, which supports complex cognition. If the LINE transposon found in octopuses is active in a similar part of their brain, that would suggest that LINE transposons support complex cognition in octopuses too, which in turn supports the hypothesis that LINE transposons are linked to advanced cognition in general. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include anything about how LINE transposons function in species other than humans. Choice C is incorrect.

Hard Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of perceptions of digital versus physical gift cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of "the time spent obtaining a gift...as a reflection of the gift’s thoughtfulness" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards view them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found physical gift cards more "socially acceptable" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards "can be purchased online from anywhere" with the fact that physical gift cards "sometimes must be purchased in person"— suggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text’s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift cards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually prefer gift cards in the more usable digital format. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients’ preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the relative ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn’t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of these factors.

Marketing experts Farnoush Reshadi, Julian Givi, and Gopal Das addressed this view in their studies of norms specifically surrounding the giving of gift cards, noting that while recipients tend to view digital gift cards (which can be purchased online from anywhere and often can be redeemed online as well) as superior to physical gift cards (which sometimes must be purchased in person and may only be redeemable in person) in terms of usage, 94.8 percent of participants surveyed indicated that it is more socially acceptable to give a physical gift card to a recipient. This finding suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text? A. gift givers likely overestimate the amount of effort required to use digital gift cards and thus mistakenly assume gift recipients will view them as less desirable than physical gift cards. B. physical gift cards are likely preferred by gift recipients because the tangible nature of those cards offers a greater psychological sense of ownership than digital gift cards do. C. physical gift cards are likely less desirable to gift recipients than digital gift cards are because of the perception that physical gift cards require unnecessary effort to obtain.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of ownership toward them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the text contrasts the two formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the difficulty involved in acquiring them and discusses how those factors influence people’s perceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the text, which explains that recipients regard digital gift cards as superior to physical ones because they are easier to use than physical cards, not because physical gift cards require greater effort to obtain than digital gift cards do.

Hard Question ID d748c3fd ID: d748c3fd In her 2021 article “Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera,” scholar Anne Garner discusses John Johnson (1882–1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign pamphlets. Johnson recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless —indeed, it wasn’t until 1968, after Johnson’s death, that Oxford University’s Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having grasped the items’ potential value to historians and other researchers.

    'Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected “ephemera,” or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson’s large collection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have access to that collection. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that “Oxford University’s Bodleian Library acquired the collection,” but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson’s collection lends support to arguments that ephemera does hold value for scholars. Medium SAT Reading and Writing',

However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Euro-American farmers’ use of Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques. According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn’t learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn’t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers’ crops were ill suited to the techniques, it’s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American farmers were beginning to recognize the benefits of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only began to recognize the benefits of the techniques much later.

    'Information and Ideas Inferences Difficulty Hard Question ID 66c47028 ID: 66c47028 In 1934 physicist Eugene Wigner posited the existence of a crystal consisting entirely of electrons in a honeycomb-like structure. The so-called Wigner crystal remained largely conjecture, however, until Feng Wang and colleagues announced in 2021 that they had captured an image of one. The researchers trapped electrons between two semiconductors and then cooled the apparatus, causing the electrons to settle into a crystalline structure. By inserting an ultrathin sheet of graphene above the crystal, the researchers obtained an impression—the first visual confirmation of the Wigner crystal. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?',
    'A',
    '{"A":"Researchers have obtained the most definitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.","B":"Researchers have identified an innovative new method for working with unusual crystalline structures.","C":"Graphene is the most important of the components required to capture an image of a Wigner crystal.","D":"It’s difficult to acquire an image of a Wigner crystal because of the crystal’s honeycomb structure."}',
    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, Eugene Wigner hypothesized that a crystal could exist that would be composed of electrons and have a honeycomb-like shape. The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconfirmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most definitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on one kind of crystal—the Wigner crystal— and doesn’t discuss crystalline structures in general. And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues figured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner crystal, it doesn’t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn’t address the relative importance of each component in that process. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t state that researchers had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure. Nothing in the text indicates why it took so long to prove the existence of this crystal or take an impression of it. Medium SAT Reading and Writing',

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about banana ripening time with and without ethylene at different temperatures. The graph shows that at 20°C, the gap between the two bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2 gridlines (from about 4 days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph shows that at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated bananas to about 11 days for untreated bananas at 14°C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for untreated bananas at 16°C; and from about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18°C). Since the gap between the bars at each of these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps is larger than the gap between the bars at 20°C, it can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute change in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at 20°C. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than ethylene-treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20°C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20°C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively). The information in the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20°C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas at the other temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that as temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14°C to about 5.5 days at 20°C, with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were associated with absolute differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature and differences in ripening time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 14°C and 16°C were about 8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 18°C and 20°C, which were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated with ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14°C and 16°C than at 18°C and 20°C. Hard Choice A is the best answer. The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases weren’t the result of soil contamination. Presence of nucleobases in the meteorite and not in soil provides evidence that those nucleobases likely didn’t come from the soil. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the conclusion. The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases weren’t the result of soil contamination. If the nucleobases are present in both the soil and meteorite, then it’s possible that these nucleobases came from the soil. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the table.

Of the 618 respondents from Quito, 82.9% indicated that they use the city’s parks, and of the 663 respondents from Lima, 72.7% indicated using city parks. Given that the percentage of Quito respondents who reported living within a 10-minute walk of a park was much lower than that reported by Lima respondents, greater proximity alone can’t explain the difference in park use.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks that is supported by the text. The text states that 82.9% of surveyed Quito residents and 72.7% of surveyed Lima residents reported using their city’s parks. The text then notes that compared to Lima respondents, a much smaller percentage of Quito respondents said they live within a 10-minute walk of a park. The text concludes that because a greater proportion of Quito respondents used parks despite generally living farther from them than Lima respondents did, "greater proximity"—being closer to a park—"can’t explain the difference in park use." That is, the text makes the point that the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks is caused by something other than the distance of the parks from city residents. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether the researchers had expected a particular result and doesn’t indicate that they were surprised by the difference in park usage between the two cities’ residents. The text simply presents the survey findings without stating the researchers’ expectations. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that there might be inaccuracies in the survey results; the text presents the findings as factual information and uses them as the basis for a conclusion that a certain factor doesn’t explain differences in park usage between Quito and Lima residents. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any sources that predate the survey or suggest that the difference in proportions was calculated using such sources.

    'Choice D is the best answer. The researchers concluded that as we approach maximum plausible surface temperatures, there will be a larger percentage of sites where thermal pollution could contribute to meeting home heating needs. By showing that only a small percentage of homes can currently use thermal pollution for home heating, and that this percentage would grow much larger at maximum plausible surface temperatures, this choice supports the researchers’ conclusion. Choice A is incorrect.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the evolution of bipedalism in humans. According to the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the behavior evolved from an ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, as modern chimpanzees and gorillas do. However, the finding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors. Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into how difficult it would’ve been to move between the ground and the trees without bipedalism; there’s no suggestion that climbing or moving in trees depends on the ability to walk on two legs rather than four, even if that ability might be helpful in certain circumstances. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t suggest that a knuckle-walking human ancestor could’ve easily moved on two legs in trees. Although the text indicates that bipedalism may have evolved from a human ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, it gives no indication of how easy it would’ve been for such an ancestor to move bipedally in trees.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker in the poem "We Are Marching" predicts future success.

Choice A is incorrect because the quotation presents a question about an activity already taking place (marching), not a statement about future success.

Medium Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view Siemomysł and Mieszko II Lambert that is supported by the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of different members. The text refers to two of the rulers in the Piast dynasty by name: Mieszko II Lambert, whose rule was known to have occurred from 1025 to 1031 CE, and Siemomysł ("whose historical actuality is disputed"), for whom less is known and who therefore is the subject of debate among historians. The text further casts doubt about Siemomysł by stating that he is "said to have ruled" during the 10th century, or the 900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn’t rule. The text also mentions that the chronicle’s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lambert. This indicates that historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert was an actual historical figure, but they disagree about whether Siemomysł existed. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the Gesta principum Polonorum’s documentation of Siemomysł comes from oral tradition—spoken rather than written documentation—unlike its records of rulers who came after Siemomysł. This suggests that the chronicle provides less reliable evidence rather than more evidence for Siemomysł’s existence in the 900s (or the 10th century) than it does for later rulers like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE.

    'Question ID b38935ab ID: b38935ab Historians point to the rule of the Piast dynasty as crucial to the formation of the Polish state. However, some differentiate between members of the dynasty like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled as king from 1025 to 1031 CE, and less well- documented figures like Siemomysł, who is said to have ruled in the 10th century but whose historical actuality is disputed. Siemomysł appears in the Gesta principum Polonorum, a chronicle of medieval Polish history written between 1112 and 1118. However, the chronicle’s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers. According to the text, what is a difference between how historians view Siemomysł and how they view Mieszko II Lambert? A. Historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert existed, but disagree about whether Siemomysł existed. B. Historians believe that the Gesta principum Polonorum provides more evidence for Siemomysł’s existence than it does for Mieszko II Lambert’s existence. C.

Medium Question ID dd1757fd ID: dd1757fd Neural networks are computer models intended to reflect the organization of human brains and are often used in studies of brain function. According to an analysis of 11,000 such networks, Rylan Schaeffer and colleagues advise caution when drawing conclusions about brains from observations of neural networks. They found that when attempting to mimic grid cells (brain cells used in navigation), while 90% of the networks could accomplish navigation-related tasks, only about 10% of those exhibited any behaviors similar to those of grid cells. But even this approximation of grid-cell activity has less to do with similarity between the neural networks and biological brains than it does with the rules programmed into the networks.

Researchers Benjamin T. Cardenas and Michael P. Lamb recently added to this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large basin in Mars’s northern hemisphere.

    'Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers’ conclusion.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t provide support for the researchers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would support the "wet and warm" theory.

Does this difference matter? In an experiment, researchers asked one group of participants to touch a mug and a toy, while another group was prohibited from touching the two items. The participants were then asked how much money they’d pay for the items. People who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than were people who weren’t allowed to touch the items. This finding suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?',

    '{"A":"people who mainly shop online probably spend more money every month than people who mainly shop in person do.","B":"in-person shopping may make products seem more valuable than they seem if only viewed online.","C":"retailers with in-person and online stores should charge the same price for a given product in both places.","D":"online retailers may be able to raise the prices they charge for products that are only available online."}',
    'Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that “people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than people who weren’t allowed to touch” them. This suggests that being able to interact with a product in person may make it seem more valuable to a shopper. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss how much people spend each month, so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people “willing to pay much more money” for it, we might predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss what retailers “should charge,” so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, the study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can touch it. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss products that are only available online, so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, products only available online would still have the problem of shoppers not being able to touch them, and the study suggests that this lowers the prices shoppers are willing to pay.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the student’s claim that putting a work online increases the number of people who experience it. The text states that the Minneapolis Institute of Art has more than 90,000 artworks. It goes on to explain that images of a subset of these works can be viewed online, such as an image of Armajani’s drawing Mississippi Delta. The text then presents a student’s claim that online images of art can increase the number of people who experience the work. If more people view Armajani’s drawing online than they do in person, this finding would support the student’s claim about the benefits of putting a work from the museum online. Thus, this finding would most directly support the claim because, if it were true, more people would view Mississippi Delta online than would visit the entire museum in person. Choice A is incorrect because information about the museum having several works by Armajani wouldn’t address the student’s claim about how putting artworks online affects the number of people who experience them. The quantity of works by one artist that are held in a museum collection wouldn’t support a claim about audience size or the impact of online accessibility. Choice B is incorrect because opinions about the museum would only relate to the institution’s reputation. This finding wouldn’t provide information about online accessibility or whether digital images increase the number of people who view specific artworks. Choice C is incorrect because critics’ praise for Mississippi Delta wouldn’t address the student’s claim about how online access increases the number of people who can experience a work. Although positive comments from art critics could affect interest in an artwork, this finding wouldn’t provide information about how many people experience the work or whether online accessibility increases that number.

    'Information and Ideas Command of Evidence Difficulty Question ID aaddd60f ID: aaddd60f Scientists studying Mars long thought the history of its crust was relatively simple. One reason for this is that geologic and climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet’s surface. A study led by Valerie Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, Payré concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text? gleaned from infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface. planets. more insight into how Earth’s crust formed.',

    'Choice D is the best answer. Cooling magma would create basalt, but “a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica.” Since Mars’s crust does contain large amounts of silica, it is unlikely that Mars’s crust was formed exclusively by cooling magma. Therefore, there were likely other major geological events that created the high silica concentrations. Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage discusses these two methods of collecting data about Mars’s crust, it never compares their reliability, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect.

    'Choice D is the best answer. The text asks us to provide examples of several states that saw rapid growth in copper production from the 1890s onward. The graph depicts Arizona, Michigan, and Montana all experiencing such rapid growth during this time period. Choice A is incorrect. The claim is about states experiencing rapid growth in copper production. This statement only discusses one state and does not provide evidence of rapid growth—in fact, it discusses a slow-down of growth. Choice B is incorrect. The claim is about states experiencing rapid growth in copper production, and this statement provides a comparison of production rates between states, rather than an example of rapid growth. Choice C is incorrect. The claim is about several states experiencing rapid growth in copper production. This statement only discusses one state and does not provide evidence of growth in copper production. Easy Choice C is the best answer because it presents the inference that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the genetic material of alpacas. The text states that modern alpacas get only 64 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the vicuña), while llamas get 95.5 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the guanaco). These data imply that relative to llamas, alpacas have experienced a much greater genetic shift away from their wild ancestors (36 percent of their genetic material derives from another source, compared to 4.5 percent of llamas’ genetic material). Moreover, the text establishes that the remainder of alpacas’ genetic material derives from llamas, and the remainder of llamas’ genetic material derives from alpacas, reflecting a period of interbreeding. Taken together, these details support the inference that the period of interbreeding had a more significant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of llamas, thereby reducing the percentage of alpacas’ genetic material that derives from wild ancestors and placing alpacas at a greater remove from these ancestors. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about genetic diversity within modern llama and alpaca populations. While the text discusses the percentage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited from its wild ancestor and from interbreeding, it does not address the level of genetic variation within each species. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that modern llama populations have a greater degree of genetic diversity than modern alpaca populations do.

The rest comes from the domesticated llama. The llama, meanwhile, gets 95.5 percent of its genetic material from its own wild ancestor, the guanaco, and the rest from the alpaca.

The genetic mixing happened thousands of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not provide details about what the process of domestication might entail. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that llama genetic material was introduced during the domestication process of alpacas. Choice D is incorrect because though the text notes that guanacos and vicuñas contributed to the genetic material of alpacas and llamas, it only discusses alpacas’ and llamas’ genetic composition.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by acknowledging that in 2022, Dimopoulos et al. were justified in arguing for antigravity on theoretical grounds because although there was no experimental evidence supporting its existence at that time, there was no evidence contradicting its existence either. The text then introduces the 2023 report describing an experiment that produced observations "thoroughly inconsistent with antigravity." Thus, the main idea is that while the study of antigravity was theoretically justified before the 2023 report (due to lack of evidence against it), the report’s findings undermine the rationale for such theoretical consideration since there is now evidence against this hypothetical phenomenon.

The table shows the average highest temperatures and average lowest temperatures in four locations in the Navajo Nation in July. According to the table, Ramah’s average highest temperature for July was 83°, whereas Cameron’s average highest temperature was much higher, at 99°. This difference illustrates the statement that the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. Choice A is incorrect because it states that Cameron and Teec Nos Pos had the same average lowest temperature (65°) for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion about the hypothesis regarding the relationship between birds’ bill size and habitat temperature. The text states that although it has been hypothesized that birds’ bill size should increase with habitat temperature (an adaptation that reflects the fact that birds can release excess heat through their bills), Probst and colleagues concluded after studying mean bill surface area in North American thrashers that this hypothesis was not fully supported. In other words, Probst and colleagues did not observe the predicted positive relationship between mean bill surface area and habitat temperature in the thrashers they studied. The data in the table about the ocellated thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the greatest mean bill surface area (3.26 cm), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (27.56°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, species such as the ocellated thrasher that have colder habitats would likely also have smaller bills. Similarly, the data about the Bendire’s thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the second-smallest mean bill surface area (1.98 cm), yet its habitat has the highest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (36.57°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, the Bendire’s thrasher and other species with warmer habitats would also have larger bills. Because data in the table show that the ocellated thrasher and the Bendire’s thrasher have the opposite or near opposite of the hypothesized relationship between bill size and habitat temperature, these examples support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion that this hypothesis isn’t fully supported. Choice A is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Bendire’s thrasher has the second-smallest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean minimum temperature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (rather than the lowest) mean maximum temperature in the warmest month. Moreover, the data about this species’ bill surface area and mean minimum temperature suggest that smaller bills are associated with colder habitats, supporting rather than challenging the hypothesis that bill size increases with habitat temperature. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Cozumel thrasher has the second-greatest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table, its habitat’s mean maximum temperature in the warmest month is not "significantly higher" than the mean maximum temperatures of the other habitats. On the contrary, the mean maximum temperature of the Cozumel thrasher’s habitat is lower than that observed for the habitats of both the Bendire’s thrasher and the long-billed thrasher. Choice C is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although this choice accurately describes the brown thrasher’s mean bill surface area and habitat temperature, it incorrectly states that the long-billed thrasher has the second-largest (rather than the third- largest) mean bill surface area of the species included. In addition, instead of revealing a lack of support for the hypothesis that bill size increases with habitat temperature, the data in this choice broadly reflect the hypothesized relationship.

Researchers studied the introduction of an electronic transfer system in one such location and found that recipients of electronic transfers consumed a different array of foods than recipients of physical transfers of the same amount did.

    'Information and Ideas Command of Evidence Difficulty Choice B is the best answer. The claim is that the lava freed the deep nitrate, allowing it to float upward. The table supports this by showing that there was more nitrate in the lava-affected seawater at various depths above 300 meters (the depth to which the lava plunged) than in unaffected seawater. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the statement in a way that supports the claim. The claim is about nitrate, not phosphate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the statement in a way that supports the claim. The claim is only about nitrate—the concentrations of phosphate aren’t relevant. Choice D is incorrect.

Medium Question ID 6409016a ID: 6409016a The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA) examines trends in economic well-being among 25,000 people in Australia unfolding over many years. As is true of most longitudinal studies, this need for years of data collection results in high costs. By contrast, a relatively straightforward fitness study, such as one that is merely trying to identify the percentage of regular exercisers in a city who do weight training, may not need a large budget because ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?',

    '{"A":"longitudinal methods are probably suitable for the fitness study.","B":"it would be easy for HILDA researchers to add questions to their economic well-being study.","C":"25,000 people is more than enough for HILDA to find tr  ends in economic well-being.","D":"the fitness study can be done well without years of data collection."}',
    'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the costs of studies. The text indicates that HILDA is a longitudinal study—it involves repeated observations over a long time—and that the "need for years of data collection" is what causes it and most other longitudinal studies to have high costs. The text then contrasts such studies with more straightforward studies, using the example of a fitness study that wants only to find out how many regular exercisers in a particular location do weight training, that may not demand a large budget. The contrast emphasized in the text most directly suggests that the fitness study may cost less than a study like HILDA because the fitness study aims only to determine a current percentage and thus can be completed well without extending data collection over years. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly introduces the idea of a less expensive, straightforward fitness study as a contrast to many longitudinal studies that, like HILDA, have high costs because they require data collection over many years. The fitness study is described as trying merely to gather information about a current behavior (how many regular exercisers do weight training) rather than track trends over time, which suggests that costs could remain low because expensive longitudinal methods would not be needed, not because they would be suitable. Choice B is incorrect because the idea that HILDA researchers could easily add questions to their study might be relevant to the costs of that survey but would be completely irrelevant as an explanation for why an unrelated fitness study may not need a large budget; the studies have no direct bearing on each other. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that HILDA involves more people than necessary would be relevant to the costs of that survey but would be completely irrelevant as an explanation for why an unrelated fitness study may not need a large budget; the studies have no direct bearing on each other.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ prediction about the language nest model of education. The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model—which is used with students during pre-K or elementary school—increased students’ fluency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The researchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride after finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the researchers predict.

    'Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to exemplify the researcher’s claim— namely, that the duration of ice on some lakes has declined between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s. According to the graph, Oulujärvi had surface ice for nearly 200 days in the winter of 1980–81 but only about 160 days of ice in the more recent winter of 2005–06, evidence of a clear decline in the duration of surface ice between these time periods. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on only one period of time (the early 1980s). Thus, the data it cites don’t support the researcher’s claim, which compares the duration of surface ice across two specific periods of time (the early 1980s and the mid-2000s). Choice B is incorrect because although it accurately describes data from the graph, it contradicts the researcher’s claim about declining surface ice duration. It describes an increase, not a decline, in the duration of surface ice on Lake Neusiedl between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s (from about 80 days in 1980–81 to about 100 days in 2005– 06). Therefore, the example of Lake Neusiedl wouldn’t logically support the claim that some lakes have seen a decline in the duration of surface ice. Choice D is incorrect because it provides information that doesn’t support the researcher’s claim about declining ice duration. The graph could indicate that both Lake Neusiedl and Oulujärvi had more than 105 days of ice in the winter of 2005–06, but on its own, this information doesn’t demonstrate a decline in ice duration between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s.

Although two other instruments are also included in the table, they obtained infrared imaging data, not spectroscopy data. Therefore, the earliest example of spectroscopy data included in the researchers’ analysis is the data obtained by VISIR at the European Southern Observatory in 2006. Choice A is incorrect. Although the table indicates that TEXES at the Gemini Observatory collected spectroscopy data in 2007 and 2019, the table also indicates that this type of data was collected in 2006 by VISIR at the European Southern Observatory. Because the VISIR data were collected in the previous year, the data obtained in 2007 by TEXES are not the earliest example of spectroscopy data included in Moses and team’s analysis of Neptune’s temperature. Choice B is incorrect because the table indicates that T-ReCS at the Gemini Observatory collected infrared imaging data, not spectroscopy data. T-ReCS therefore cannot be the source of the earliest example of spectroscopy data that is included in Moses and colleagues’ analysis of Neptune’s temperature. Additionally, the T-ReCS data were collected in 2007, meaning that these data were obtained later than any type of data collected in 2006. Choice D is incorrect.

Hard Question ID 3882ddf6 ID: 3882ddf6 To investigate the history of plate subduction—when one of Earth’s tectonic plates slides beneath another—Sarah M. Aarons and colleagues compared ancient rocks from the Acasta Gneiss Complex in Canada to modern rocks. Using isotope analysis, the researchers found that Acasta rocks dating to about 4.02 billion years ago (bya) most strongly resemble modern rocks formed in a plume setting (an area in which hot rocks from Earth’s mantle flow upward into the crust). By contrast, they found that Acasta rocks dating to about 3.75 bya and 3.6 bya have an isotope composition that is similar to that of modern rocks formed in a subduction setting.

    'Choice A is the best answer. Because researchers found “Acasta rocks dating to about 3.75 bya” were similar to “modern rocks formed in a subduction setting,” we can infer that subduction-like processes must have begun occurring in the Acasta Gneiss Complex by this time. Choice B is incorrect. We only know about geological processes at the Acasta Gneiss Complex, so we do not have information to make inferences about geological processes in general. Also, notice that the rocks dated to 4.02 bya were found to still be formed in a plume setting, so the transition must have happened after this time. Choice C is incorrect. There’s no mention in the passage of what proportion of the rocks within Acasta Gneiss Complex were formed through subduction, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however, have long been thought to be undefinable. To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modified piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece. They found that participants were more than seven times likelier to characterize the modified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?',

    'Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants were “more than seven times likelier to characterize the modified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing.” Because the modified songs had been changed by altering the timing of the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing. Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers “synchronized the offbeats” in the modified songs, they also “delayed the downbeats” in those songs. Because we can’t disentangle whether it was the synchronized offbeats, the delayed downbeats, or the combination of both that increased the song’s swing, we don’t have enough information to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention whether or not it’s difficult for a jazz musician to give a song swing, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Dumas Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that the venom produced by the scorpion species Centruroides granosus helps mitigate, or reduce, risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success. According to the text, Gálvez and colleagues found that the venom used by C. granosus both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, a pathogen that, if ingested by C. granosus, would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that E. coli is commonly found in species preyed on by C. granosus and, moreover, can withstand C. granosus’s digestive juices after ingestion, this would suggest that C. granosus likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize E. coli to make E. coli-infected prey safe for consumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, C. granosus’s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen’s growth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for C. granosus against E. coli that its digestive system wouldn’t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding. Choice A is incorrect because a finding that E. coli doesn’t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for C. granosus even when venom isn’t used would weaken rather than strengthen Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that a particular form of venom production spread in C. granosus in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that E.

Choice C is incorrect because a finding that C. granosus can detect and avoid consuming E. coli-infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production is the primary factor that reduces C. granosus’s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary pressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn’t clearly support the conclusion that C. granosus’s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is incorrect because Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion focuses on C. granosus venom in relation to the risk of E. coli, and a finding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don’t pose a risk if consumed, wouldn’t be relevant to the conclusion that C. granosus’s particular form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding.

Kelly Gillespie, Rex Bernardo, and other plant specialists are building on that work by exploring the development of shorter corn varieties.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion about a trade-off in growing shorter varieties of corn. The text explains that plant specialists are working to develop shorter corn varieties in an effort to improve yields. The text points out that although greater height in corn plants can lead to more ears of corn per plant, it also makes the stalks more likely to be damaged by strong winds before there is a chance to harvest the corn. This presents a clear trade-off between potential yield (taller plants producing more ears per plant) and harvest reliability (shorter plants surviving until harvest time). Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that shorter corn varieties, while possibly producing fewer ears per plant, would be more likely to survive until harvest time. This survival advantage would result in improved yields of harvested corn because more plants would remain intact, thus offsetting the potential reduction in ears per shorter plant. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, greater height makes cornstalks vulnerable to snapping or being uprooted in strong winds, implying that taller plants—not shorter ones—have greater stability problems. The text provides no basis for inferring that shorter corn varieties would be more likely to be uprooted due to corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the opposite relationship between height and stability. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about the land requirements of either shorter corn varieties or shorter wheat and rice varieties, much less make any comparisons. The text mentions that plant breeders in the 1950s and ’60s created shorter varieties of wheat and rice with improved yields and that researchers are now exploring shorter corn varieties, but it doesn’t compare land-use requirements of these crops. Choice D is incorrect because the idea that shorter cornstalks would yield more ears of corn would contradict the relationship between height and corn production described in the text.

Such identification is heightened by “invisible editing,” or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist.

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.” What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication? method may be. cell architectures. and storing solar power.',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion about whitefly-induced defenses in tomato plants. According to the text, tomato plants produce airborne chemicals that prompt nearby tomato plants to increase their production of appropriate defensive chemicals, such as jasmonic acid in response to herbivory and salicylic acid in response to microbial infection. The text goes on to indicate that researchers concluded that whiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that cause nearby plants to defend against microbial infection instead of herbivory from whiteflies. The graph shows that control tomato plants (plants that weren’t exposed to any chemicals from nearby tomato plants and weren’t subsequently infested with whiteflies) produced about 140 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 120 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, which indicates the baseline levels of these defensive chemicals in tomato plants. The graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when subsequently infested by whiteflies, which is more than the amount produced by the control plants. This suggests that when infested with whiteflies, tomato plants that weren’t previously exposed to air from nearby whitefly-infested plants begin producing higher levels of jasmonic acid to defend against the infestation. Finally, the graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants and then subsequently infested by whiteflies produced approximately 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight (which is less than control plants did) and approximately 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than control plants did). This suggests that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit chemical signals that decrease nearby plants’ defenses against whitefly herbivory relative to baseline levels and redirect their defenses toward microbial infection, thereby supporting the researchers’ conclusion that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit airborne chemical signals that induce nearby plants to preferentially defend against microbes even when experiencing herbivory from whiteflies. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph shows that tomato plants exposed to whitefly-infested plants produced less jasmonic acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight vs. about 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight), and although this might suggest that those plants are therefore better defended against microbial attack than against herbivory, this wouldn’t be sufficient to conclude that this is the case: without reference to the relative levels of defensive chemicals produced by the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be impossible to conclude that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants either induces or diminishes these plants’ defenses to different kinds of threats. Furthermore, the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, not that they produced the same amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph.

The fact that many movies received an average star rating doesn’t tell us anything about the relationship between emotionality and box office success. Choice D is incorrect.

McKay first presents a somewhat negative view of New York City, describing watching “dark figures” who “sadly shuffle” to work at dawn, and then indicates that he would instead like to be “in the heart of the island of the sea.” Choice A is incorrect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (New York City, with its “lonely newsboy” and “red streaks” in the sky at dawn) rather than on different feelings about two places. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (which isn’t named) rather than on McKay’s different feelings about two places. Choice D is incorrect because though McKay presents a negative image of an unnamed place with “tired cars” that grumble, moan, and groan, and “old milk carts“ that rumble by under “dull stars,” the quotation focuses on McKay’s feelings about only one place rather than on different feelings about two places.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the assertion about urban agriculture. The graph shows the average survey ratings, on a scale of 0 to 5, from three groups of people—project leaders, stakeholders, and the general public—concerning the contributions of urban agriculture. According to the graph, project leaders gave an average rating of approximately 2 to urban agriculture’s contributions to the provision of medicinal plants, which is lower than the average rating of approximately 3 that project leaders gave to urban agriculture’s contributions to both improving the local microclimate and improving a sense of attachment to the neighborhood. This shows that project leaders rated urban agriculture as contributing less to providing medicinal plants than to improving the local microclimate. Choice B is incorrect because the graph doesn’t provide data about urban agriculture’s contribution to educational opportunities; therefore, this comparison can’t be made. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the data shown in the graph. On average, project leaders gave a rating of approximately 3 to urban agriculture’s contributions to improving the local microclimate, which is higher, not lower, than the average rating of approximately 2 that they gave to its contributions to providing medicinal plants. Choice D is incorrect because the graph doesn’t provide data about urban agriculture’s contribution to providing tourist attractions; therefore, this comparison can’t be made. Medium Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by noting a common intuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which raises the question of what is the reason for being against lying. The text then presents Pallikkathayil’s answer to this question: we have a duty to respect others’ agential interests (that is, we have an obligation to allow people to exercise their free will in order to best serve their own ends), false beliefs constrain agency (the implication here being that people who are deceived about what is true are impeded in acting in their own best interests), and so we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliberately deceive a person) unless doing so prevents a greater limitation on someone’s agency or prevents some otherwise impermissible end (for example, it might be morally permissible to lie to someone in the rare circumstance where a false belief would lead a person to act in their own best interest, and where they would not do so if they knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that Pallikkathayil offers a potential justification for opposing lying based on respecting agency, while still allowing for exceptions in specific circumstances. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t focus on people’s lack of a principled way to identify circumstances where lying is permissible or indicate that Pallikkathayil’s argument resolves this specific problem. Rather, the text presents Pallikkathayil’s argument that lies limit agency but may be permitted in very specific situations (to prevent a greater limitation on someone’s agency or an otherwise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible arguments about SAT Reading and Writing',
    'Question ID e80ba20d ID: e80ba20d Philosophers note that many people have an intuitive sense that while we ought not to lie, there may be circumstances in which lying is permissible. If this intuition is correct and we lack an inviolable duty to speak truthfully, what grounds opposition to lying in the first place? Japa Pallikkathayil has advanced one answer by appealing to a duty to respect others’ agential interests: the possession of false beliefs constrains agency, and thus we ought not to impede the formation of true beliefs unless doing so prevents a greater constraint on someone’s agency or an otherwise impermissible end. Which choice best states the main idea of the text? A. One potential means of justifying opposition to lying is Pallikkathayil’s argument that we have an obligation to respect other people’s agency that entails a commitment to truthfulness except in certain circumstances. B. Many people have an intuitive sense that lying is permissible in some circumstances but lack a principled way to identify those circumstances, and Pallikkathayil’s argument may provide a means of resolving that problem. C. Pallikkathayil’s argument suggests that if we have a duty to respect other people’s agential interests and if possession of false beliefs constrains agency, then we have an inviolable duty to speak truthfully. D. Pallikkathayil’s argument shows that if our intuition that circumstances may make lying permissible is correct, then it is unclear whether there are any grounds for an opposition to lying in the first place.',

    'Choice C is the best answer. The graph shows that the CNO-treated females were way more active than the CNO-treated males, while the saline-treated males and females (the control groups) had very similar activity levels. This supports the claim that there were sex-specific differences in the mice’s response to neuron activation. Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. All four groups of mice started at nearly the same activity level before treatment (see how all four points are very close together at -4 minutes, meaning four minutes before treatment). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the assertion. The assertion is about the mice’s response to neuron activation, so we need to include the data about the CNO-treated females and males. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The line for the CNO-treated males does not show a “substantial decline” until around 122 minutes, and there is no “steep increase” afterward. Medium Choice A is the best answer. This choice illustrates both “feeling frightened in controlled situations” (the haunted house) and the benefit of a boosted mood (“less stressed”) and confidence (“very accomplished”). Choice B is incorrect. This choice isn’t the best illustration of the claim. While laughing may indicate a good mood, this choice provides no evidence of “feeling frightened” or boosted confidence. Another choice provides better evidence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn’t the best illustration of the claim. This choice demonstrates “feeling frightened” in a controlled environment, but it doesn’t provide strong evidence of boosted mood or confidence. Another choice provides better evidence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t the best illustration of the claim. While a “sense of relief” could be interpreted as a boosted mood, this choice doesn’t provide direct evidence of “feeling frightened” or of increased confidence.

    'Question ID 08b28c1a ID: 08b28c1a A researcher conducted an experiment inspired by studies suggesting that people may benefit from feeling frightened in certain circumstances, such as when watching scary movies or visiting haunted attractions. The researcher recruited several participants and had them walk through a local haunted house attraction. Immediately after exiting the attraction, each participant completed a survey about their experience. Based on the survey responses, the researcher claims that feeling frightened in controlled situations can boost a person’s mood and confidence.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the research team’s conclusion about anatomical features and speech detection in dogs. The text explains that a team of researchers monitored the brain activity of dogs while the dogs listened to three recordings: one of spoken Spanish, one of spoken Hungarian, and one of scrambled fragments that weren’t recognizable as human speech. The text then states that the team concluded that differences in dogs’ anatomical features may affect their ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. The finding that longer-headed dogs exhibited a greater difference in brain activity when listening to the speech recordings (in Spanish or Hungarian) versus the nonspeech (scrambled) recording compared with shorter-headed dogs would establish an association between an anatomical feature (head length) and responses (as measured by brain activity) to speech versus nonspeech. This observed relationship between head length and brain activity patterns during exposure to speech and nonspeech would support the team’s conclusion. Choice A is incorrect because it describes a finding about dogs’ responses (as indicated by brain activity) to hearing their respective familiar languages rather than dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech, which is what the team’s conclusion specifically addresses. Moreover, this finding pertains to only one anatomical type (long-headed dogs), so it wouldn’t support the conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech.

To support that conclusion, the finding would need to show how dogs with different anatomical features (for example, long- headed and short-headed dogs) respond to recordings of speech as well as recordings of nonspeech. Choice D is incorrect because it describes a finding about dogs’ ability to distinguish between a familiar language and an unfamiliar one, not between speech and nonspeech.

Planes travel faster than trains, but air travel typically requires 3 hours of lead time for security, baggage handling, and boarding that rail travel doesn’t, so short- haul routes take similar amounts of time by air and by rail. However, the model suggests that as rail passenger volumes approach current capacity limits, long lead times emerge.

    'Choice B is the best answer. Air travel usually requires much more “lead time” than train travel, so short flights end up taking the same amount of time as a train trip to the same destination. But train travel starts to need more “lead time” when the trains approach their capacity limits. This suggests that train companies should add more trains for these routes if they want to encourage travelers to take a train instead of a plane. Choice A is incorrect.

In his first major work, Arachne (1956), Hunt constructed the mythical character Arachne, a weaver who was changed into a spider, by welding bits of steel together into something that, although vaguely human, is strange and machine-like.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, many of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B. Wells as “using mainly flowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized flame.” Thus, the main idea is that Hunt often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt’s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important historical figure; Arachne is a “mythical character.” Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt’s style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt’s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt’s style haven’t changed over that time.

    'Information and Ideas Central Ideas and Details Difficulty Question ID 659c6c1d ID: 659c6c1d The following text is adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1883 novel Treasure Island. Bill is a sailor staying at the Admiral Benbow, an inn run by the narrator’s parents. Every day when [Bill] came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did [stay] at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present. According to the text, why does Bill regularly ask about “seafaring men”?',

    'Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. Choice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover,  information about the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Hard Choice A is the best answer. This finding would most strongly support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. This finding suggests that the sail helped the dinosaur make sharp turns more quickly, which supports that hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the sail displacing more water would relate to that hypothesis —it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the difference in battery power between the models would relate to that hypothesis—it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This finding would actually weaken the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey.

    'Question ID 5d6ab069 ID: 5d6ab069 Jan Gimsa, Robert Sleigh, and Ulrike Gimsa have hypothesized that the sail-like structure running down the back of the dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus improved the animal’s success in underwater pursuits of prey species capable of making quick, evasive movements. To evaluate their hypothesis, a second team of researchers constructed two battery-powered mechanical models of S. aegyptiacus, one with a sail and one without, and subjected the models to a series of identical tests in a water-filled tank. Which finding from the model tests, if true, would most strongly support Gimsa and colleagues’ hypothesis? A. The model with a sail took significantly less time to complete a sharp turn while submerged than the model without a sail did. B.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that is supported by the text. The last sentence of the text explains that historians of capitalism generally rely on a type of data that requires "archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa." Nevertheless, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars have demonstrated that features of capitalism including "returns-focused investment,...open markets for wage labor, and other features of capitalism" existed in parts of Africa before colonization. Because archival records typically used by historians of capitalism aren′t available for precolonial Africa, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars of precolonial capitalism in Africa likely used atypical sources for their studies. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that archival records containing longitudinal economic data "do not exist for much of precolonial Africa." If these records don’t exist for precolonial Africa, then Alfagali and other Africanist scholars couldn’t derive data from them by any method. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alfagali and other Africanist scholars define capitalism differently than other historians of capitalism do. On the contrary, the text simply asserts that specific features they found, such as "returns-focused investment [and] open markets for wage labor," are "features of capitalism," which implies scholarly agreement that these activities are capitalist in nature. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate any effects of capitalism in Africa, positive or negative.

It tells us about Tobar’s initial career as a journalist, but it doesn’t say anything about him “applying journalism techniques” to his fiction-writing. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. It tells us that Tobar applied fiction techniques to his nonfiction writing, but we’re looking for evidence of the other way around: that Tobar applied journalism techniques to his fiction-writing.

    'Question ID 1d08c7ee ID: 1d08c7ee Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Héctor Tobar has built a multifaceted career as both a journalist and an author of short stories and novels. In an essay about Tobar’s work, a student claims that Tobar blends his areas of expertise by applying journalism techniques to his creation of works of fiction. Which quotation from a literary critic best supports the student’s claim? A. “For one novel, an imagined account of a real person’s global travels, Tobar approached his subject like a reporter, interviewing people the man had met along the way and researching the man’s own writings.” B. “Tobar got his start as a volunteer for El Tecolote, a community newspaper in San Francisco, and wrote for newspapers for years before earning a degree in creative writing and starting to publish works of fiction.” C. “Many of Tobar’s notable nonfiction articles are marked by the writer’s use of techniques usually associated with fiction, such as complex narrative structures and the incorporation of symbolism.” D. “The protagonist of Tobar’s third novel is a man who wants to be a novelist and keeps notes about interesting people he encounters so he can use them when developing characters for his stories.”',

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents a conclusion about the role of fynbos roots in maintaining the border with the Afro-temperate forest that can be reasonably inferred from the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos have "uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil." The text then describes an experiment where forest tree seedlings grown in plots isolated from fynbos roots grew at a rate fiv   e times greater than seedlings in areas near fynbos roots. This strongly suggests that fynbos roots are depleting soil nutrients to such an extent that forest plants can’t get enough nutrients from that soil to flourish, thereby hindering the formation of any significant "transition space" between the habitats and helping keep the border between them sharp. Choice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that fynbos roots physically damage the root systems of forest plants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as having "uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil."

The experiment then confirms this function of the roots by showing that forest seedlings "isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate fiv   e times greater" than those near fynbos roots.

    'Choice D is the best answer because the quotation directly illustrates Patty trying hard to convince Mrs. Trent to allow the group to continue sharing a room. The phrase "Patty did use all the diplomacy at her command" explicitly shows her making a determined effort to be persuasive. The quotation further details Patty’s specific tactics: she "dwelt touchingly upon their long friendship, and their sorrow at being separated." These details illustrate the claim by suggesting that Patty carefully crafted and delivered an emotional appeal to Mrs. Trent about the effects of changing the group’s rooming situation. Choice A is incorrect because although the quotation describes a reaction by Mrs. Trent, it does not reveal anything about the events or conversation that might have prompted this reaction. Instead of depicting Patty’s efforts to be persuasive during such a conversation, the quotation focuses on Mrs. Trent’s character traits; specifically, it describes the relationship between her "sense of humour" and her "sense of justice." While the latter trait may be relevant to Patty’s situation, the quotation doesn’t show the extent of her efforts to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the change in rooming arrangements. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation describes the reaction of a group of three students immediately after an encounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the outcome of an implied conversation but does not provide any evidence about the topic or nature of the conversation itself, and therefore does not illustrate Patty’s efforts during a conversation to convince Mrs. Trent to change her mind about the rooming situation. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation suggests that Patty can be assertive (she abruptly grabbed her friends and "shoved them into the empty schoolroom"), it doesn’t show Patty asserting herself by trying to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the proposed rooming arrangements. The quotation doesn’t allude to Mrs. Trent or to Patty’s desire to continue sharing a room with a group of friends. SAT Reading and Writing',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text.

Thus, the text mainly praises Dunbar for being especially perceptive about people and nature. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the “hearts and souls of men” and the “language of flowers” to convey Dunbar’s ability to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read any of these things or has read a great deal about them. Choice C is incorrect because the text notes how well Dunbar has made sense of the topics he’s written about but doesn’t address any specific parts of Dunbar’s writing process beyond the suggestion that he used a pen. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on Dunbar’s understanding of people and nature as expressed in his writing.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Veronica Waweru’s thinking that is supported by the text. The text begins by discussing Waweru’s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been played at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone. The text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued to play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the presence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru "noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone," this observation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not specifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely suggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used for that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru found the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn’t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was played, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any variation in the depth of the pits. The text only describes the pits collectively as shallow and doesn’t indicate that the depth of the pits factored into Waweru’s thinking about how long the site had been used for playing mancala.

Testing by Yuzo R. Yanagisuru, Otar Akanyeti, and James C.

For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.

Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Bay and Tulum, had intermediate tourism development, and two others, Mahahual and Xahuayxol, had low tourism development. It is reasonable to infer that sites with intermediate tourism have a greater human presence than those with low tourism and therefore are subject to greater amounts of wastewater and exhibit higher delta 15-N values in seagrass. However, Camacho-Cruz and colleagues found that the increase in delta 15-N values was not constant. The table supports this conclusion because the two intermediate-tourism sites (Akumal Bay and Tulum) had delta 15-N values that fluctuated considerably—both had higher delta 15-N values than the two low-tourism sites (Mahahual and Xahuayxol) in October 2016 and October 2017, but in February 2017 the delta 15-N values for the intermediate-tourism sites dropped significantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low- tourism site, had a higher delta 15-N value for that period). The fluctuations in values in Akumal Bay and Tulum support the conclusion that these sites experienced influxes of human wastewater intermittently. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table: in February 2017 the delta 15-N value in Akumal Bay was higher than the delta 15-N value in Xahuayxol, not lower. Choice B is incorrect because the absence of data for delta 15-N levels in Akumal Bay in February 2016 would neither prove nor disprove that the presence of human wastewater at Akumal Bay and Tulum was not constant. Despite the unavailable data, there is still enough information to conclude that delta 15-N levels at both sites fluctuated significantly and that influxes of human wastewater therefore happened intermittently. Choice C is incorrect because a constancy in delta 15-N values would not indicate that the influx of human wastewater was intermittent, but rather the opposite. Moreover, the two periods selected are not indicative of general trends in the whole table (for example, the values fluctuated significantly in Akumal Bay between February 2017 and October 2017, and in Tulum between October 2016 and February 2017).

This often makes it fairly easy to determine how old a tree was when it was cut down. To do so, you look at the tree stump and count the dark rings you see.

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents a detail that, if true, would most directly support the researcher’s claim about the difficulty of determining olive tree age by ring counting. The text explains that for many trees, counting the dark rings visible in a tree stump is a reliable method for determining the tree’s age. However, if olive trees have growth rings that are difficult to see, it would be hard to count the individual rings. Therefore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or impossible to use for olive trees. This directly supports the researcher’s claim that the ring-counting method often can’t be used for olive trees because it identifies a specific characteristic of olive trees that could render this approach impracticable. Choice A is incorrect because the probable age of the oldest olive tree doesn’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work for determining olive tree age. The older age of some olive trees might make counting more tedious but doesn’t pose an insurmountable obstacle to adopting the method. The researcher’s claim is about the feasibility of the ring-counting method for olive trees, not about the potential impracticality of employing this method for particularly long-lived trees. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that narrow growth rings might indicate harsh growing conditions has no direct bearing on the claim that counting rings often can’t be used to determine olive tree age. It is possible that growth rings that are too narrowly spaced might be difficult to count, but the researcher’s claim relates to the inapplicability of the ring-counting method to olive trees in general rather than to olive trees that have experienced harsh conditions. Moreover, as long as they are visible, even narrow growth rings might permit the ring-counting method to be used to determine tree age. Choice D is incorrect because the ideal climate conditions for olive trees don’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work as a method for determining their age. While growing conditions might affect ring formation patterns, the simple fact that olive trees thrive in hot, dry environments doesn’t directly address why the conventional method of counting rings would be ineffective for determining their age.

She wanted audiences to feel like they were watching real people on screen. She would encourage actors in her films to behave naturally. Guy-Blaché even hung a large sign reading “Be Natural” in the studio where she made her films.

This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s films was very unusual for the time. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s films, and in fact suggests the opposite—that it was unusual for directors to suggest this style of acting at the time. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses actors’ familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s films, so there isn’t much basis for this inference.

However, erosion and past resurfacing events could have modified the surface of the planet. Therefore, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reflect past volcanic activity. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars’s surface such that its current appearance isn’t a reliable guide to past activity, not that it’s likely that past eruptions were not as massive as astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn’t imply that the ash discussed in the text likely came from multiple volcanoes. Although it’s possible that the ash came from different volcanoes, there’s no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than volcanic eruptions. Although the text does suggest that the evidence consistent with volcanic eruptions shouldn’t be taken as definitive proof of past eruptions, that doesn’t mean that the craters couldn’t have been created by eruptions, only that we can’t be certain they were.

    'Information and Ideas Central Ideas and Details Difficulty Question ID d8b78a2b ID: d8b78a2b Red velvet cake has been a favorite dessert of many for years, but the recipe’s origins are unclear. A bakery in Dallas, Texas, argued that it created the first recipe for the cake when the bakery opened in the 1860s. The Adams Extract Co., which sells baking products, claims to have created the recipe in the 1930s to help market their red dye. A US hotel and a Canadian department store also publicly stated that the red velvet cake sold in each of their establishments in the 1930s was an original creation, each alleging that it was the recipe author. No clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others, however. It thus seems that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?',
    'B',
    '{"A":"red velvet cake was first baked sometime before the 1860s.","B":"we cannot say at present who actually baked the first red velvet cake.","C":"none of the supposed inventors of red velvet cake are likely to have invented it.","D":"the bakery in Dallas, Texas, probably invented red velvet cake."}',
    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of competing claims about the origins of red velvet cake. The text states that the origins of the recipe for red velvet cake "are unclear." The text then presents four different entities that claim to have created the first red velvet cake recipe: a Dallas bakery (1860s), the Adams Extract Co. (1930s), a US hotel (1930s), and a Canadian department store (1930s). Lastly, the text states that "no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others." Given this information, it most logically follows that it’s not possible to determine who baked the first red velvet cake, as there is insufficient evidence to determine which claim, if any, is correct. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information indicating that red velvet cake existed before the 1860s. According to the text, the earliest claim for creating red velvet cake comes from a bakery in Dallas, Texas, that asserted it developed the first recipe for the cake at the time of the bakery’s opening in the 1860s. There’s no textual support for the conclusion that the cake existed before this earliest claimed date, since the text presents only competing claims starting from the 1860s and extending to the 1930s without evidence of earlier origins. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the conclusion that none of the supposed inventors of red velvet cake likely invented the cake. The text states that multiple entities claim to have invented the recipe and that "no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others." This lack of decisive evidence doesn’t logically lead to the conclusion that all the claims are false; it merely indicates that the cake’s true origins can’t be determined with the available evidence. The text leaves open the possibility that one of the claimants could indeed be the actual inventor. Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no basis for concluding that the Dallas bakery is "probably" the inventor of red velvet cake.

This choice shows that people suggested removing things to achieve improvements a lot less often than they suggested adding things, which supports the claim that people tend not to think of removing things as a likely way to improve the university. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. We are looking to prove that people suggested subtractive means of achieving improvements less often than other means, but this choice doesn’t address how often people made subtractive suggestions. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Invalid responses were incomprehensible, so we can’t compare what they were suggesting to what was being suggested in subtractive responses. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. Fewer than 100 suggestions were coded as subtractive. 175 is the approximate number of suggestions coded as “neither additive or subtractive.” Medium Choice B is the best answer.    Whitten thinks the tool made “one gesture” paintings, while historians think the tool “removed gesture” from the process completely. But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the historians would agree that the paintings he made with the tool in the ’70s have way fewer gestures than his paintings from the ’60s, in which gestures are “prevalent,” meaning widely and extensively present. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only discusses the “developer”—it never mentions other tools. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became more interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestures, and his ’70s paintings only had “one gesture.” Choice D is incorrect.

    'Question ID 9abc3ba5 ID: 9abc3ba5 “Gestures” in painting are typically thought of as bold, expressive brushstrokes. In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of “slab” paintings from that decade.  Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,” signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture, both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text? A. any tool that a painter uses to create an artwork is capable of creating gestures. B. Whitten’s work from the 1960s exhibits many more gestures than his work from the 1970s does. C.

The text explains that after the Galleria dell’Accademia began offering online tours, there were concerns that if people viewed these virtual tours, they would consider an in-person visit to be unnecessary. The finding that many visitors who were surveyed indicated that the virtual tours actually convinced them to plan an in-person visit directly contradicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in- person visits, virtual tours actively encouraged them, providing strong support for the administrators’ claim that the initial concerns were unfounded. Choice B is incorrect. The finding that most surveyed visitors were unaware of the virtual tours before their first in-person visit wouldn’t directly address whether virtual tours affect decisions about in-person visits. This finding would only indicate that these particular visitors didn’t have the opportunity to be influenced by virtual tours when making their decision to visit.

Importantly, the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffrey’s History, Wace added "the famous Round Table" to it. If Wace introduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element was not present in earlier works. This suggests that the Arthurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci, which was written before both Geoffrey’s and Wace’s works, would not have featured the Round Table.

Although the text indicates that the Arthurian legends in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History differ from those in Wace’s Roman de Brut in that Wace added the idea of the Round Table, the text doesn’t compare the overall content of the Arthurian legends in the two works and doesn’t indicate anything about the overall content of the legends in Culhwch and Olwen.

    'Choice B is the best answer. Dramaturges help playwrights with storytelling and characterization. Choreographers often tell stories through dance, so they are also concerned with storytelling and characterization. This suggests that the fact that choreographers seek the help of dramaturges with the storytelling aspects of their dances should be “unsurprising.” Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The beginning of the text does imply that this is true, but the end is leading to a conclusion about how choreographers use dramaturges. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never mentions dances by choreographers who don’t incorporate narrative elements. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text mentions in passing that directors use dramaturges to conduct research, but it never suggests that directors and actors are too reliant on them.

    'Choice D is the best answer. This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually “invites classification as Indigenous art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity. Choice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya influence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be defined by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim.

    'Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able to vote. We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both the main way people qualified to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had significant French real estate holdings. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don’t have enough information to determine if those with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it’s possible that those with significant foreign investments were likely to also be people with significant domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don’t have the information necessary to make this inference.

The researchers found many of the same bacterial genera in both the plants’ leaves and roots. To explain this, the researchers pointed to the general proximity of A. thaliana leaves to the ground and noted that rain splashing off soil could bring soil-based bacteria into contact with the leaves.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of patterns of linguistic distribution in New York City. The text explains how Chinese immigrants in New York City tend to settle in different boroughs based on their region of origin in China: those from north China (Mandarin speakers) typically settle in Queens, while those from south China (Cantonese or Fuzhounese speakers) typically settle in Manhattan. This pattern demonstrates that the regional language distribution in China (north versus south) has reproduced itself in New York City (Queens versus Manhattan). Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that correlations between languages and regions in one country can replicate themselves when citizens of that country emigrate to a new country. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss rates of language change. The text indicates that many languages are spoken in New York City, but it doesn’t provide any information about how quickly these languages might be changing, either in relation to each other or compared to areas where fewer languages are spoken. Choice B is incorrect because the text provides no information about changes in vocabulary or pronunciation of immigrant languages compared to their original forms. The text only discusses where different groups of language speakers tend to settle, not how their languages might have evolved after immigration. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide any information about a relationship between a country’s physical size and the number of languages spoken there. While the text mentions that over 600 languages are spoken in New York City, it doesn’t relate this to the physical size of New York or the United States, nor does it suggest that large countries like China have more languages than geographically smaller countries.

The speaker emphasizes the calmness of the scene, noting that the "race of wind is stilled" and the atmosphere is sleepy ("slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world"), and then indicates that the calmness prompts thoughts of how old age might be "sweet" and "quiet" and "gracious in retreat" after "a windy youth" with "storms."

And rather than suggesting that old age involves struggles, the speaker suggests that after "a windy youth" with "storms" to be weathered, old age will be "sweet," "quiet," and "gracious"—that is, old age will be tranquil like a port at night. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker isn’t suggesting that a person who has lived a varied and active life might find it difficult to stay in a calm place in old age. On the contrary, the speaker suggests that after a "windy youth" with "storms," old age can be welcomed as something "sweet," "quiet," and "gracious," just like a calm port at night.

Researchers Youran Fu and Marshall Fisher have found that combining sellers’ own data with information gathered from social media can dramatically improve the accuracy of such forecasts—by 24 to 57 percent in the cases they directly studied. Better predictions mean demand is easier to meet without retailers becoming overstocked. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?',

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that fashion retailers face challenges in forecasting product demand due to rapidly changing tastes and lengthy manufacturing times. It then presents research by Fu and Fisher showing that combining retailers’ own data with social media information significantly improves forecast accuracy. The text concludes by noting that better predictions help retailers meet demand without becoming overstocked. Thus, the main idea is that using multiple data sources (retailers’ own data combined with social media information) can enhance fashion retailers’ ability to anticipate demand. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t claim that social media is revolutionizing, or fundamentally changing, how sellers and researchers view the fashion industry. The text never addresses the way the fashion industry is viewed; rather, it discusses a practical approach sellers in the industry can take to better match production with demand. Choice C is incorrect. Although avoiding overstocking is mentioned as a benefit of an approach that can help fashion sellers better predict demand, the text doesn’t focus on overstocking or characterize it as the main concern of sellers. Rather, the text is focused on discussing the approach itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that fashion sellers encounter obstacles when using their own data to try to forecast demand as tastes and styles change; the text focuses on the idea that instead of using their own data alone, retailers should combine their own data with social media information to more accurately forecast demand.

Choice B is incorrect because if Sevilla and Townsend found that at both upscale and inexpensive stores, participants judged jewelry spaced far apart to be less valuable than jewelry spaced close together, that would show the opposite of the effect the researchers observed in their earlier experiments, not show that an inexpensive store context merely moderates, or lessens, that effect.

    'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of consumer expectations and the struggles delivery companies face. The text states that while consumers expect ever-faster delivery of goods, delivery companies "continue to struggle with last-mile logistics." The text further explains that innovations aimed at addressing this challenge have a tendency to cause complications of their own. Because escalating consumer demands for speed are paired with persistent, complex delivery obstacles and new problems arising from attempted solutions, it logically follows that consumer expectations for delivery times may be exceeding what companies can feasibly provide. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea of delivery volumes at all and makes it clear that companies are already aware of and trying to address consumers’ expectations for delivery. Further, the challenge presented at the end of the text relates to new problems that tend to arise with solutions for logistical problems, not to a lack of understanding of what consumers want or how delivery volumes fluctuate.

    'Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figur  ative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret.

To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks benefited the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?',

    'Choice C is the best answer because  it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the moss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that would best support Granito and Álvarez’s claim that fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious.

If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body’s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and Álvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food’s digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn’t provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and Álvarez’s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that SAT Reading and Writing',

Hard Question ID 65502c46 ID: 65502c46 In a 2017 article, historian Jasmine Kilburn-Toppin explains that in early modern London, members of the city’s guilds (trade and artisanal associations) were participants in a civic culture in which gift giving both signaled and conferred social status. Research on this phenomenon has tended to focus on philanthropic gifting by London’s largest guilds; for her part, Kilburn- Toppin focuses on the gifting of handmade objects and fixtures (such as decorative paneling or plasterwork) within the craft guilds, which were “composed of highly discerning producers and consumers of material cultures.” Given this characterization, it can reasonably be inferred that the gifting of such objects may have ______ Which choice most logically completes the text? guilds. belonged to a craft guild.',

    'Choice C is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of the role of gift giving among members of guilds in early modern London. According to the text, members of these guilds participated in a culture where giving gifts "both signaled and conferred social status"—that is, it indicated people’s social standing and also gave them social standing —and occurred in the forms of both philanthropic gifting (donations for humanitarian purposes) by large guilds, which much research has focused on, and the gifting of handmade items between craft guild members, which Kilburn-Toppin focuses on. The text indicates that Kilburn-Toppin characterizes craft guild members as people who made and consumed items and were "highly discerning," or were careful judges of quality. Because gift giving benefited one’s status and if craft guild members were particularly attentive to quality, it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds—between people who had high standards for items they made and for items they received—may have been a way for members to maintain and enhance their professional reputations, or their professional statuses, among their peers. Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes the idea that members of guilds participated in gift giving both to display and receive social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the "highly discerning" members of craft guilds had to do with the members’ interest in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the practice of gifting those items within the craft guilds was intended to limit knowledge of materials and techniques to the members of those guilds. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between "ostentatious," or very showy, and "prosaic," or ordinary, gifts and because the characterization at the end of the text pertains specifically to the gifting of handmade items SAT Reading and Writing',

But biologist Angela Stöger and her team analyzed hundreds of hours of recordings of giraffes in three European zoos and found that giraffes make a very low-pitched humming sound.

    'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes use humming to communicate when they cannot signal to one another visually. The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low- pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support Stöger and her team’s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound. Choice A is incorrect because finding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, Stöger and her team’s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because finding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support Stöger and her team’s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different species could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could not conclude anything about the function of giraffe humming from a finding that some other animals in zoos also hum.

Five young siblings have just moved with their parents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect’s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.

In a recent study, however, researchers trained a deep-learning computer model on thousands of images of pottery fragments and found that it could categorize them as accurately as a team of expert archaeologists.

    'Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can—a finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won’t be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace.

Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models.

Hard Question ID 03701ef3 ID: 03701ef3 To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps’ burrows. Resin casting involves completely filling an empty burrow with a liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying the burrow.
